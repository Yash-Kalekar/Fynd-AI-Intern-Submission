"A nice place to shop, but I wouldn't want to live there. 

I never used to be a department store shopper, but recently Ive discovered that nicer cloths just seem to fit better. Go figure. While I still like getting a deal, I usually wait until there is a clearance or sale or some type. The macy's at scottsdale fashion square seems to have more selection, such as more size options for the items you seem to like and a few more items to choose from also. For guys, I would suggest checking out the Dillards at fashion square; the mens dept is about the size of this entire macy's store. 2 or 3 times a year dillards has an awesome clearance event and you can pickup 65% off clearance prices; which are usually already 50 - 70% off the original price.

I digress; this is supposed to be a review of macy's. If you're in the biltmore area and looking for higher end quality shopping go ahead and check them out, then travel down camelback to fashion square mall when they tell you the item you like is only available in your size at a different store.",3

"Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest. 

So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. 

But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. 

I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. ""Wow,"" I thought, ""It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."" 

So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. 

Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. 

Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. 

Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

"Two times a year, you can meander down Mill Ave and the adjoining streets to look at an array of art for sale. Everything from jewelry and pop art posters to handmade kitchen utensils, photography and abstract paintings. 

If you go both in Spring and Winter, you're likely to see a few of the same artists. For the most part, Tempe Arts Festival does a great job of providing variety. Plus, it's fun to wander and look at things you may not have seen before - let alone expected to see at an arts festival. 

This isn't the most exciting of art festivals. There's really no live music, unless you count the occasional melodies of flutes you hear when you walk by the vendor selling his handmade wooden flutes. 

I've been three times and enjoyed myself every time. I wasn't wowed. I never saw anything I couldn't live without. But, like I said, this is a fun event to mark on your calender for both Spring and Winter - even if it happens to rain during the festival. 

I give last Winter's and this Spring's festivals both a 4-star review, for the weather and company were great. It was my first year going, and I was happy to see that Tempe offered the Valley something that appealed to people who really do try and appreciate art. After all, it's a ""consumer"" type of event, geared toward bringing the community and artists together. I can appreciate that. 

I give this Winter's festival a 3-star review. The rain didn't phase me. I can deal with a few sprinkles. What bothered me was the mixing of ASU and UofA fans, both groups beginning to gather down on Mill Ave for the football showdown. Don't get me wrong, I love a good sporting event and understand team rivalry. I just thought it was unfortunate that the upcoming game and the fans' excitement took over the relaxed, casual feel that the arts festival usually has - you know, when you can walk down the street and look at art without running into an impromptu cheer section. 

You see, fans were screaming in the streets - hollering insults to the other team - and waving their school's colors high. (Once again, I understand the fun of that. I just didn't expect it to be all over the streets in the early afternoon. Maybe I'm naive, though.) The fans were a definite distraction from the art festival. Knowing what would happen when alcohol was mixed into the equation, my friend and I decided to bolt. 

Lucky we did. Seems like Tempe can't handle a few rain droplets, for when we were walking back to the car, a street lamp post nearly fell on our heads. Talk about a commotion. 

I'd much rather attention be fixed on the art festival rather than any football game or falling lamp posts, no matter how dramatic both of those things can be.

I s'pose this echoes the old saying, ""There's a time and place for everything.""

Word to the wise: Parking can be hard to find, or require you to shell out $10 for a spot. If you can, park somewhere closeby that's free of charge and hoof it on foot.",4
Older restrant but very good food,4
"We were visiting again, so of course that means at least 2 trips to Sugar Bowl!  The food, service and ice cream were good as always, but WOW, the prices sure have gone up.  I know that the economy sucks, but for what we got, the prices just don't seem to justify it.  We had different waitresses both times.  The fist was efficient but not very warm.  We had Sandra on our second visit - and YES, she remembered us again!  Could not believe it.  She is very friendly and can really keep up when they get swamped.  We will be back, but maybe only once per visit instead of 2 (or 3 or 4) times.  Just can't afford those prices for what you get.",3
"I've always said if the guacamole, chips and salsa aren't good, the food is not likely to be good either.  I was right, Guacamole was not very good at all, same with the salsa.  Rest of the food was just okay but for a restaurant in the Biltmore I expected so much better.  Just as a note, when it comes to Mexican food, I'm super critical.  This place will probably get a higher ratings from people of the Midwest.",2
Best Subway anywhere. Super-friendly staff and always really clean!,5
Yum!  The toasted barley app is delicious. My boyfriend and I shared the eggplant sandwich and the monk burger. Both of the sandwiches were outstanding. The service was great too. We will definitely go back.,5
Now they are using a hand held drill to buff toenails during their pedi instead of just a quick file.  I can definitely see grow out difference on my nail bed.  Not good.,2
"Stopped in Sunday for lunch after a high recommendation from a friend of mine in San Diego.   She claimed it was the best sub she's ever had so I had to try it.  Unfortunately my sub came up short with lack of taste and toppings.  When we pulled up I noticed it was super busy and was thinking man they must have great subs for it to be so packed.  Was lucky to get a booth inside but it wasn't as clean as others have stated in other reviews.  I had to take one of their comment cards and wipe the table of all crumbs on the ground as others had obviously done from the looks of the floor.  I had the Chipotle Cheese Steak sub that I split with my husband.  The bread tasted ok, but it wasn't fresh out of the oven. They skimpt on the steak and hardly saw any onions at all on it.  For the price of the sandwich I really was expecting to get more.  The sauce was the best thing about it but I was wanting more of it as well.  I won't be going back.  Sad that it wasn't a better first impression.",2
"My picks:
Derby Smash
Green Chili Risotto
Pan Seared Escolar
Sticky Buns

If you are looking for Arizona charm, this is the place. Every Arizona resident needs to experience this hidden gem.

Thanks Jacquie, Kristy & Tim for continuing to believe in this historic restaurant and landmark!",5
"This is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere, Downtown Phoenix.  My art teacher friend got fixated on bringing me here when she heard me complaining about Phoenix being chain hell (and thanks to her and Yelp, I don't believe that anymore).  I think she chose wisely as I loved this little space.  

It was a nice place to stop and check out, and then of course we had lunch at the attached City Bakery.  A perfect activity for a half-day of school!  Hooray creativity and uniqueness!",5
"So I've been back to Ra a few times now, and while the food is always acceptable, the service has gotten progressively worse each time. Today my co-worker and I actually waited an unbelievable 50 minutes for our food, which - if your waitress stops by, checks in with you, apologizes, lets you know she knows you've been waiting - wouldn't have been nearly so bad. Still extremely annoying, sure, but forgiveable. Not this waitress - we had to call her over for every thing we needed. Serioulsy, not once did she just stop by to check on us. We had to call her over to place our drink order, ask for sugar for our tea, to place our food order, to get the check, everything. So by the time the food came, I had to scarf down my grilled apple teriyaki salmon brick in 5 minutes to make it back to work on time. That's it, Ra - you've lost another customer.",2
"By far the best asian market in the entire valley! I first discovered Lee Lee's tempe location and was so happy when they opened this location in the west valley.  Amazing selection from produce, meats, and asian. The staff is super nice. Never have had a poor experience in all the years. Shelves are clean and organized.  Prices are great too.",5
"This Chipotle Rocks!  
Today, I express my joy
In the haiku form!

Perfect fast food joint;
Fresh, delicious, quick and kind.
The price is right, too!

Burritos galore;
In a tortilla or bowl.
But wait, there is more!

Three steak tacos, please!
Or grilled veggie fajitas?
Oh sweet perfection.

A simple menu,
Yet so many decisions.
How can you go wrong?

Answer:  You cannot!  
Order now, you won't regret,
This Chipotle Rocks!",5
"I think Matt's has had its '5 minutes of fame'.  Note to owners: Your food is good enough,  your staff is great, so please save your money and move to a better location.  Right now, you're next to a rundown hotel with police baracade tape all over the place.The local residents(?) pan-handling all the waiting customers outside your place. Seriously?   Just sad.  Won't go again, won't recommend it either.  Good luck this summer, the heat will melt all your 'waiting area' customers out .",2
"My first ever trip to Bass was overwhelming. Like walking into a Sportsman's Warehouse that had mated with Dick's Sporting Goods, and then gone on steroids. Bass Pro Shops is an outdoor person's dream. 

And it's good for the whole family, oddly enough!

Once you get inside this massive place, you have an upstairs and downstairs. There is a kid's area, a restaurant with fresh fish, a huge women's section and mens, and areas for fishing and boats and hunting and camping and survival and gear for any occasion. You can look at the giant fish tank, climb up a faux rock side for $3, and just be purely entertained for ages. They have snack foods and jerky and sweets. BBQ grills. Do they have guns? I don't know, probably! They have GPS equipment and water bottles and on and on and on. 

It was exhausting in a great way. My camping/outdoors needs tend to be more mimimalist oriented so I prefer an REI. But I like it here a lot. I picked up some socks that have a lifetime guarantee, and a nice woolen shirt for almost nothing, and a couple of gifts for the hunter/outdoors people in my life back in Tucson.

Bass: it is an experience.",4
"This bar is ok to hang out at. I think its sort of frumpy. The drinks are fine, I've never eaten there.  They have PBR there. 

Lots of local people mostly regulars. Anyone can go there an fit in there.  I have been a few times but it's not a place I spend a lot of time.",3
"The food wasn't that good but that wasn't my main issue. It was the unwelcoming feeling I experienced. I will not be returning. The owner was friendly with everyone in the restaurant except my boyfriend and I. He would go table to table and talk to people and greet new customers and would acknowledge them when they left. The only acknowledgement I was received was an uncomfortable feeling of him staring at me when I wasn't looking, I'm assuming due to my abundance of tattoos. I felt judged and will not recommend this place to my friends or will never return.",2
"One of the best breakfast burrito selections in town.

My personal favorite is the breakfast supreme w/ red sauce ( and root beer the size of my head).

The decor may be meh, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it. 

They deliver, are always nice, and never busy (which is unfortunate). Definitely a diamond in the rough.",4
"My wife and I were looking for a particular type of rose for our garden. We called this location and asked if they had it in stock and what the price was. They said they did and quoted us a price of $24.99 for a gallon sized plant. Good to go. We drive there and find the rose bush but it is listed as $44.99. So we go to the front and say that  we had called and driven 30 minutes to get this rose and we were told ""Oops...sometimes the  prices on my list up front right"". No sh!t Sherlock. So...will you honor the price quoted? NO. 

So we drove down the street to A And P Nursery on Baseline west of Lindsay and got the same size plant that they were selling for $44.99 for $16.99. 

Don't waste your time with these rip-off artists.",1
"i cannot give this place 5 stars because i went there today at 3:30 and IT WAS CLOSED.  what business closes at 3?  REALLY?  oh phoenix, you're killing me.

BUT the food (creative, delicious sandwiches and desserts), speedy service, and reasonable prices really do deserve 5 stars.  The chicken/asparagus/havarti sandwich almost killed my taste buds with its deliciousness.  i went for carry-out at a peak time (about 12:30) and TOTAL, from joining the 6-person line to walking out the door, I probably spent about 15 minutes there.  very fast service=very happy jenny.

i didn't get dessert, but i will be back on a day when i'm feeling either very fit or very depressed.  maybe tomorrow, due to my 3 PM CLOSE TIME funk.  crimeny. 
:)",4
"This is great if you are in a hurry, they have slices and salads ready to go. Above average quality and a nice open space too. Perfect stop before or after catching a movie next door.",3
"New and big yes... but not my favorite spring training park.

5 stars for being big and roomy and also lots of grass in the outfield

2 stars for being almost like a major league park. Feels like you are attending a MLB regular season game. They lost out on the small spring training feel and intimacy.

0 stars for being the only cactus league park I visited this spring not allowing you to bring in food like candy or peanuts or sunflower seeds. You realize why when you see the pricey beer and food vendors inside.",2
"Wow, servers were a bunch of stuck up b's in corset's... that's original. Didn't eat, but wanted to check out the crowd on a Friday night.  Bleh... typical NoSco crowd of gym jockeys in Affliction shirts two sizes too small... late 40's women with enough botox to look early 40's and a few lost 20 somethings stretching to pay $12 for a drink.  The cover band made it an easy decision to bail and salvage the night at Eddy V's with some great oysters and live jazz from actual musicians.",2
"Enjoyed dinner on the patio - I had the Pad Cha Seafood dish rated ""Thai hot"" - the so-called hottest dish on the menu.  The person I was with ordered the ginger fish - mediocre at best, although it looked great with a variety of vegetables and pineapple.  I felt the dishes looked better than they actually tasted.  The seafood (mussels, calamari, salmon, shrimp) in my dish was very fresh but it wasn't Thai hot at all.  The ambiance of their patio was enjoyable and the Thai iced tea was very tasty although a little too sweet towards the end.  Overall, I will probably give this restaurant another try in the future but I wasn't very impressed with the taste of the food.",3
"One word: bleh. I know my Thai food and this place was about 1 star, an extra star for the nice service. I came here with my mom, uncle, and aunt and being my first time, I opted to order my usual pad see ew. We also ordered coconut fried shrimps, the mango papaya salad, tom yum soup, and fried rice. Honestly, the best thing about our order was the coconut fried shrimps. It came out hot a crispy and flavorful. Everything else needed help. 

The fried rice was too overwhelming, it tasted like too much fish sauce and was very salty. The Tom yum soup was a little bland and we had to add fish sauce to it, and the pad see ew was way too darn spicy for being a ""mild/medium"". It was full of this unpleasant pepper flavor that I definitely wasn't use to in my pad see ew as well. My aunt and uncle think that the place hired a new head chef or something, because since they're regulars, the food this time around was definitely not worth the bill. We ended up to-going 60% of the food untouched so that we can tweak it ourselves at home to our liking. 

All in all, there are other places around town with better food - 1 star. 1star for the friendly staff.",2
"I have just relocated to Scottsdale and eager to find a great wine bar and/or restaurant with a great wine list...and 5th and Wine was the one place that everyone recommended, so I was eager to check it out!

I decided to check it out one night after work, and asked a few co-workers for some delish food choices to try...the bruschetta was the one to try!

I loved the ambiance, very social atmosphere, nice bar scene and small tables, but they also had another room for tables further away from the bar which was more chill and quiet atmosphere.  I was quickly seated at a nice table in the more quiet area, and could scope out the scene. 

I started with a delish glass of Charles LaFitte - Brut France sparking...which for $9 was a deal and refreshing!

I quickly scanned the menu for the bruschetta and my mouth started to water with the selections.  I opted for the prosciutto/fig/marscapone bruschetta and the standard mozzarella/tomato/basil bruschetta!  Both were totally delicious!  The bread was lightly toasted and a bit soft...not like your typical ""crunchy"" bread bruschetta...which I actually enjoyed more than I thought I would.  

I ordered the Beef Bourguignon Julia Childs' ""Beef, Wine, Bacon, Mushroom Stew"" over egg noodles...for $16.96...again, a total deal and totally tasty!  The beef melted in my mouth and the mushroom and sauce was hearty and flavorful!

All in all, the meal was wonderful, and the service was great - very attentive staff - Jonathan, my waiter, was super personable. I also met Scott Yanni, one of the owners, who came over to see how my meal was...and he was very gracious when I told him that I just relocated here and was very happy to find his restaurant as one of my new favorites!

I will definitely be back for more of their great menu and tasty libations!",4
"Awesome Saturday breakfast buffet (until 11am). I wanted a resort style brunch setting to treat my folks too while they were in town. The service here is impeccable as are the grounds, which deserve a good walking through after you gorge yourself on heaps of fresh fruit, pastries, bacon and eggs. Located in central Scottsdale.",4
"The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste.  The SMALLEST wings I have ever seen, they must be off of baby chicks.  I thought it was getting punked, actually LOL.  Never to be back",1
"This was the most HORRIBLE floor cleaning I have ever seen!!!!! We took before and after pictures and cannot tell the difference at all! The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job! I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We paid $1000 and got $20 worth of service. I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the ""staining as he would say"" off easily. I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning....can you read the saying? That is exctaly how we felt after the service. REALLY?!?!?",1
"""trendy, loud-music, ok-sushi!"" - 2/5

When we lived right across the street from the Sushi Brokers, J and I used to go there at least once a month for its happy hour. We probably had been there at least 8 times with friends and family. I have to say that the quality was good for the start but went downhill since then. The price was right if you go during the happy hour. Other time, kinda expensive with the quality and service. It was a seen-to-be-seen place with ok-quality sushi.",2
"We had a group reservation for The Old Town Tortilla Factory, that was great. The problem was that was about all that was great about the place. The credit card machine in the bar was down for the time we were waiting for our table, chips and salsa was $7 and the food was not really good at all. I had asked our waitress about two items and she suggested the restaurants signature dish Pollo Margarita, stuffed chicken breast with chiptole mashed potato cake and seasonal vegetables. The chicken was extremely dry the stuffing was bland and the mashed potato cake was the same bland and dry. The only thing good to eat was the freshly made tortillas.",2
"This place makes some of the best vegan gelato/ice cream I've had. If you're vegan, skip the (kinda gross) soy froyo, and eat one of the gelatos. The service was super friendly and all the gelatos were super tasty. I had a big scoop of peanut butter soy gelato. It was by far the best peanut butter based ice cream I've ever had.",4
"The features in the room seem outdated.  The room was a sauna when I got in and could not fix the problem because the thermostat was hard to figure out.  I woke up in the middle of the night because it was unbearable and a staff person did come by and was able to make the room a little cooler.

I like the check-in and check-out kiosks so I don't have to wait on a line for a live person who seemed to be just chatting away with someone.",3
"Considering this is the only gym I've ever been in, it's great! They have updated equipment and lots of them. I usually go during one of the busy times and can always get on a machine, or do the things I want to. Plus they have classes which are good. And every time me & my boyfriend walk in & out of the Y, a nice gal at the food counter greets us and says goodbye. We still never order anything, though...

They lose a star though because I HATE WORKING OUT!  Sigh...",4
"Stopped in there December 17th. They have a great sound system that fills this large bar up nicely.  I got the sampler platter and it's all fried, and it was definitely edible, I was wanting more! Lot's of beers on tap. Chuck the owner is very nice and easy to talk to and always has a grin.  Julie is a hard worker and keeps the beers flowing, take of the wait staff and they will take care of you.  Oh they had a live band there, Whiskey Tango was the name of the band.  I left there with money in my pocket, this place will not break you, it's a working mans bar. I will definitely go back there!!!",4
Can't say enough about this place. We were amazed by the room and it's stylings and even more amazed with the pool and the view from it. We were on a mission to chill and found the perfect place. Views of Camelback Mountain and a staff that knew what they were doing. Try the brie quesadillas and the Sanctuary lemonade.,5
"I give up. When you can still see the dough through the sauce and the cheese and the $2.00 extra cheese, and when the manager looks at it and says ""yeah, that's extra cheese"", I won't be going back. Sorry.",2
"I have lived here for about 5 months, the place is okay i guess, the ground are clean which I like, but the staff seems kinda disorganized.. they got our move in dates wrong which thank god I'm an early mover and didn't wait to the last min, then when we FINALLY moved in, we got a different apt than we were showed originally. The linen closet has a big freakin heater tank in it. Which okay whatever i guess is not that big of a deal but then I found out we pay more for our water because its not divided out between everyone else. Also EVERYTHING breaks our shower has broken twice, the closet light broke out the wall, the bathroom light fell out of the wall, the kitchen stove and the washer has all broke from the time we moved in (Last May). the only reason i give it 2 stars is because i do know there are a lot worse apartments out there but still my house is falling apart! When I go in the office i feel they always try and rush me out because i can finish my questions its really annoying. So be careful when looking at these apartments when looking for a place to live.",2
I love that this restaurant can accommodate  all types of people. It's a sports bar with Family style entertainment! The staff is always friendly and  they aim to please. The food is always good and prices are very reasonable. The bar is on one side so it splits the Families with children on the other side with an amazing area with tvs to play Xbox and wii. Check this place out. You won't be disappointed.,5
"I am not a fan of this place. I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial ""positive sandwich""

Top Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is, its a cute little place that is very easy to find.

The Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it. 

Lettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes

Bottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client. I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things. I personally have not had a good experience with this place, but I respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have.",1
Will never eat here again. Sandwich was meteocre and overpriced. On top Of that I was charged more than I was told the total was. Horrible first time experience!,1
"They must have renovated this place in the last year. It is now spacious and airy and there is no longer the dreaded ""hover over a table to get a seat"" necessity.  It now reminds me much more of the dreaded ""Panera Bread"" chain in California, but the food is still much better and has much less of a ""mass produced"" feeling and taste.

The service (management, staff etc) were extremely attentive and responsive to requests as well as keeping the place extremely well clean and cleared.

I love carbs...Carbs with carbs and a side of carbs.  They serve warm syrup with their pancakes (yum!) and their bread is just amazing.  

The ""side of pancakes"" is plenty big for a meal and they are always consistent, fluffy, and tasty.  

They offer both a dark roast and a house roast for coffee and all the powdery loveliness (cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa) to top it off just right.

Today, before returning to the land of freeways and smog and eternal sunshine(well, the other land of that anyway) we enjoyed their peppermint hot chocolate. I would highly recommend that you run on it and have this frothy goodness before the holiday season ends!",4
"It does not get much better than this, fellas.

BS West is hands down the best gay bar in Phoenix.

Friendly bartenders, cheap drinks, good-looking crowd, great music..it's definitely got it all.

Best night to check out is the obvious 2-4-1 Wednesday. 

Thursdays and Sundays can also be fun if you're into karaoke. Saturdays are a nice alternative if you don't really dig Forbidden or Amsterdam, it's a different crowd.

It definitely has a ""Cheers"" feeling to it... not pretentious whatsoever. Great patios too, especially the back one with the new video screen they installed.

Oh, and their Halloween bash is THE party to be at. 3,000 people attended in 2007.",5
"My wife and I have going to this restaurant on Thursday night for past three months to have a beer and a slice.  A couple weeks ago I went there for the usual but there was an NFL game and a World series game on and the restaurant was busy.  I put my name in and waited for my wife and the table.  30 minutes went by and wife had not shown up and the table had just become available.  Hostess said I can't seat you unless your other party shows up first.  I called my wife, she cancelled.  Hostess would not seat me as a single...TERRIBLE..Hostess did not tell me this when I first put my name in.  WON'T BE GOING TO ANY OF THE ZIPPS EVER AGAIN.",1
"It was family day (the ex and I like to see our son smile) and we were starving... after driving around for a while we pulled up to Arriba's and said ""what the hell...""

That's also what we said when some of the food came, as in ""what the hell is this??""

So positive first.  The server was pretty quick and he gave refills without being asked.  Chips and salsa were good.  Chips were warm and salsa had a nice (suprising) kick.  Kick... do I sound like an old lady? 

Morgan and I ordered fish tacos and beef tacos, respectively, so we could swap one for one.  Fish was ok... nothing spectacular... but honestly I would rather pay for one at freakin Del Taco or Rubios.  Not worth it here.  Rice was ok, some flavor, probably converted rice though.  Beans were... blended?  I dunno about you but I like to see some actual BEANS in my beans!  This stuff was like brown goo... YUMMMMMMMM... :P

The beef taco was just weird.  I swear to God is tasted like gyro meat!  WTF?  I couldn't eat much of it.  

Last but not least, Dom ordered the White Sands Chimichanga.  That sh*t looked nasty to be honest.  Covered with some gooey white sauce, filled with pork.  LOL, he said it tasted like hot dog.  Um, yikes!  He took about 2 bites and was ""full"".  A.K.A., he didn't like it.

I also had a margarita... it was HUGE and didn't taste very good.  I'd rather have one 1/4 that size that tasted nice.  Oh well.

One star for the chips and salsa.  Like I said, the fish taco was okay, but every thing was just way over-priced!  

Final verdict?  We decided to NEVER go there again.",1
"Let me qualify my review by stating that I have not been to Butter & Me.  I have had their yummy mini cupcakes at a Yelp event.

I tried the red velvet mini cupcake.  It was really good.  Moist and flavorful with a rich creamy frosting.  Yum.  I chased it with few sips of Cruz tequila.  Hey, it was in my other hand.

I also tried a chocolate mini cupcake.  Yummy.  Again, moist and delicious.  I don't know how they keep the mini ones from drying out.  When I make mini muffins at home they dry out easily (that is if any survive the first half hour...the survival rate for any kind of pastry in my vicinity is exceedingly low).

I also garnered a few extra cupcakes to take back to my wife and a friend and score points.  Mini cupcakes=brownie points.",4
"This was my go to Vietnamese restaurant for pho and rice plates not because it's my favorite but because of convenience. Pho Avina is closer to me but that place is terrible so I end up going to this place. It also helps that LeeLee Supermarket is one street over so I get a Viet fix and my Asian needs shopping in one trip. The pho and com tam is average. The service is fast and friendly enough. I do find it a big stingy that they don't bring out the bowl of broth/soup before you get your rice plate unless you ask for it. 

All in all this place is fine if you just want an average meal; nothing to rave about here. If I felt like driving farther, I'd definitely hit up Pho Van in Chandler for pho or Com Tam Thuan Kieu in Mesa for com tam.",3
"I, like another reviewer, was not willing to fight for lunch at McDonald's... and so I travelled up the road to Burger King. I haven't been to a BK in years and have heard several quips about their ""new and updated menu."" 

I got a Whopper Jr. meal (no update there). Their fries are good, more satisfying than other fast food restaurants-- ""now with sea salt""-- as if that makes them more appealing. 

The Whopper Jr. itself is just... meh.. I'm sorry, I don't do mayo. I do appreciate the fresh (?) veggies on top though. 

Soda seems syrupy here to me.

If McDonald's is busy, head here. They DO have a nice outdoor patio, though. And Iike their workers' uniforms better. Does that count??",3
Ditto what Kristi M. said.  Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find this place.,5
"It's a supermarket.  I just go in buy what I need and get out.  It's convenient that there's a wells fargo in there, but there's one across the street as well.  

To the negative experience.....
My sister was speaking to my niece, but not in english.  Some caucasian lady walks by and rudely says, ""Can't you speak english?""  WTF?!?  Is this taking SB 1070 in your own hands?  It's like you're trying to make every race hate you even more.  I will run into this arrogance wherever I go.

I'm not done yet.  Keep on reading....
My niece had a dollar in her hand and was pointing at the lottery scratcher machine.  We know you have to be of a certain age to play it.  One of the employees there rushes over and in a loud voice tells me niece she can't play it.  Calm down.  Kids are just innocent and don't need this extra verbal abuse in their lives.  Don't you have something better to do like restock the shelves?  Swear... Racial profiling.",1
"I'm a fan of the bistro. Today, however, a seemingly 'customer' was going behind the kitchen area, flipping my pizza and even entering the kitchen door. What? If you are an owner and are enjoying the bistro, act like a customer! I was kind of disturbed by a casual guy eating in the restaurant with his family and then going to get  cups, plates, and food from the serving area. Can I do that next time? I hope I go back. I have taken friends. As I said , I am a fan. You need my business.",4
"Met some friends here for happy hour the other day.  This is the old El Paso BBQ and they did a knockout job with the remodel. Great feel and warm colors to the place now.

I had a couple of Coronas and some chips and guacamole.  The regular menu looks better than the happy hour menu and think I'll try them the next time for lunch or dinner.",3
"I know... I know... it's Phoenix but I expected something far better.  Perhaps my mistake.  Located in what looks like an old fast food location this is a no frills, no cart, and no nonsense dim sum experience.  Don't think I will be going back (for many reasons) but if you are craving some bao or need a dumpling fix this place will do... just dont expect much.",2
"*Gamestop Burger*


Visiting a friend in Phoenix I first see Smashburger from the street. Upon first glance my other friend and I thought it was a Gamestop cuz the sign looked just like it. We both said ""Haha, we thought that was a Gamestop.""
Our friend goes, ""Yeah I first thought that too when I first saw it. It's pretty good there. Do you guys wanna go?"" 

So we ended up eating our first meal in Phoenix at Smashburger, and we were glad we did. The food was really good, and the smashfires were a great addition to our burgers.

I ordered the BBQ Bacon & Cheese. It was quite delicious, and a little on the greasy side. BUT that's where all the flavor is!!!!!

This burger has some hot steamy buns. Yeah I said it .
Unlike most places that use the typical sesame seed bun Smashburger uses egg buns. These buns are a lot softer and compliment the burger very nicely. 

I decided to order the smashfries which are seasoned with garlic and rosemary. These were an awesome choice. For those of you who may not like those flavors they offer regular fries as well. 

Seeing that I hadn't eaten since morning I also ordered the Arizona devil dog. This had guacamole, tomatoes, jalapenos, habenero cheese and a spicy chipotle sauce all on an all beef hot dog. I liked it. It was like nachos minus the chips on my hot dog. 

Now this place is on the pricey side, but if you feel like dishing out $8+ for a burger and fries then this place is not too shabby. 

Different locations call for different items on the menu, so don't be surprised if the Arizona devil dog cannot be found outside of Arizona. I say that they should combine all the regional menus to make one giant-mega selection-awesomeness menu. But I highly doubt that'll happen.",4
"The Family and I went back here on Saturday night. 

The food is just as spectacular as it was the first time we went! 

The service however was just not good. Our waiter seemed dazed and confused the whole time we were there. And slllllow. He also forgot stuff, I ordered a second glass of wine mid dinner and it never came, and I was never given the option to remind him because he did not come back until it was time to clear the plates! We sat at our table, all of us with empty plates for a good 10-15 minutes with out anyone coming by to clear them. We just sat there. Not cool, and its not like he was in another section, there was a table he was at 3 separate times that was directly behind ours, he just chose to ignore ours. 

We will go back as we do like the food and atmosphere and hopefully the service will improve.",3
"I'll be back! 

Laura certainly doesn't need my review for help, but all of these people are correct.  She is meticulous, easy to be around and takes joy in her work.  When I read all of the 5 star reviews, I sort of thought they might be written by friends because they were so gushy.  I found her via Yelp.... and loved her! 

$20 eyebrow wax, takes credit cards.",5
Honey Bear's is no Joe's BBQ in Gilbert but I actually enjoy it. I usually get the pork sandwich and potato salad and I find myself going here. I like the BBQ sauce and the quality of the meat is good. If I'm in Tempe and want BBQ I usually go here.,3
"I'm giving this Office Max five stars for convenience, friendly service, competitively priced products a stocked shelves. 

This Office Max is a great in and out shop. On one side there is the detailed supply store and on the office side, there is a complete copy center. It's open until 9 on the weekdays and they don't make you feel rushed if you get there at oh let's say...8:50. In fact, they are helpful! They walked me around and helped me find the random items I needed. The copy center staff was also very friendly. 

This Office Max has your complete supply of office items but their prices are very reasonable! I purchased the same item at another shop that I did here and it was significantly less expensive here. 

So on that note, I end my review on Office Max but I will report back with any new findings.",5
"Jack in the Box, this one in particular, is busiest from 10pm-2am. It definitely a ""better when your drunk"" kind of place, or at least I think it is from the number of drunk patrons I see eating there. 

The food? Well, it's JitB, what do you expect? You got the 99 cent for 2 tacos deal, which is a must add for any meal. You also have breakfast served all day. This means you can get a Extreme Sausage Sandwhich, 2 Tacos, and a Chicken Fajita Pita in the same meal. That's some good eatin'. Please note that nothing about the Chicken Fajita Pita is remotely close to an actual fajita. 

This location specializes in making your food NOT look like it does in the picture. The picture may show a big fluffy bun with a juicy burger, however your burger will probably look like someone stepped on it then ran it over with their car. It doesn't change the taste, tho. Still tastes exactly like you would expect something to taste from JitB. I mean, it's good food and a good value. By ""good"" food, I of course mean greasy and unhealthy. That is the definition of good food though, right?",3
"And then it all changed...

I think this is my very first review that has been demoted to 1 star after being on the coveted 5 star for a long time. 

So, where do I start. After feeling dog sick for a few days, I finally decided to ""walk-in"" to this place because that's what they do now supposedly. They take walk in patients who are seen by the NP. I signed in at 8:20 and was not called in the back until 10:00am. Then I waited another 35 minutes for the NP to come in and see me. By the time everything was over, it was 11:00am before I walked out of this place. 

I asked to talk to Brenda, the office manager and was brushed off twice. Supposedly she is going to call me but would not see me when i was there for two and a half hours! I guess she didn't have the balls to face me at that point. What could she have said really? 

The front desk lady did a screw up and let another walk in patient go before me even though he came 10 minutes after I had already signed in. When I pointed that out, she said he came before me and I had to show her the sign in chart. Instead of apologizing, she just kept doing what she was busy doing without acknowledging her mistake. 

When the NP did come see me, she missed a couple of key things in my chart that she totally should have asked me about. I was quite appalled. I had to point out a deathly allergy that I have even though it should already be in my chart. 

My final analysis: In my opinion, don't go here if your health and time are valuable to you.",1
"After repeat visits it just gets worse - the service, that is.  It was as if we were held hostage and could not leave for a full 25 minutes because that's how long it took to receive hour check after several requests to several different employees.  Female servers might be somewhat cute but know absolutely nothing about beer and this is a brewpub.  I asked if they have an seasonal beers and the reply was no, that they only sell their own beers!  Even more amusing is their ""industrial pale ale"" is an IPA but it is not bitter.  So, they say it's an IPA but it's not bitter, it's not a true-to-style IPA.  Then people say ""Oh I don't like IPA's"" and want something else.  Their attempt to rename a beer/style is actually hurting them.  Amazing.

The menu was not the regular menu, just a small list of about 4-5 choices.  To make it worse, the actual menu on every table was wrong, yet the kept the menus on the tables anyway.  I heard 3 separate tables order the fried raviolis but they did not have them.  

This place is *only* in business because of the location, location, location.",1
"I should have taken my own advice and stayed far away from this place. Our most recent visit ended hastily when I was served rotten tuna and got barely a ""sorry"" from the staff. I could smell that the fish had gone horribly, horribly off when the ahi tuna salad was put before me by the waiter, and I'm shocked that the kitchen actually thought they'd get away with sending it out. The waiter disappeared so quickly from my table that I had to go hunt him down to point out the bad smell at my table was coming from the food, and he took my plate back to the kitchen and five minutes later came back to say, ""okay, we all smelled it and there's definitely something wrong there.""

Seriously? You had to go pass it around to confirm that I'm not crazy when you can clearly tell within ten seconds that this is not how raw fish should smell? After all this, their solution was to comp an appetizer, not the salad, and eventually gave me a new salad to go, which I decided not to eat just to be on the safe side. 

Look, I'm not scared to eat week old leftovers or sushi at a divey joint and I don't really get freaked out by the cleanliness of restaurants, but this could have been dangerous.  I have absolutely warned off all my coworkers and friends against this place, and now I'm warning all of Yelp. It could have been handled in a way that left me confident that it was just another new restaurant kink, but the awful service made it clear that's not the case and I shudder to think of what new low they'll sink to.",1
"Place is OK, I'm just not a big fan of what they have to offer! It's funny reading some of the complaints! People get a grip! Food is good, place is a cafe style, so your service is really up to you! Cookies are really good, my wife enjoys their sandwiches.",3
"Only reason for the 2 stars is for the service. 
The food was not very good at all. My dinner was hardshell taco's or something that consist of hardshell taco's but when they came out the shells were soggy and you couldn't eat them. 
The drink specials were good and we had a very nice server.",2
"This is one of my favorite go-to places in Phoenix, and I feel fortunate to live just a mile away. 

The atmosphere is excellent - low-lighting, wooden floors, modern decor in a vintage-looking house-turned-restaurant. 

The food is even better. I have never ordered anything I didn't love (with the exception of the cheesecake, which isn't made in-house - it was just okay). I crave their tuna salad on a regular basis - it's good both in the tuna salad salad and in the tuna salad sandwich.  The grilled cheese is the bomb, and so is the cashew butter banana sandwich. The mac and cheese is superb, as well. Seriously, everything rocks. I highly recommend ordering the mixed greens as your side if you get a sandwich - the dressing is light and citrusy and smacks of homemade excellence. 

Oh, and it won't empty your wallet, either. The prices are excellent for the quality of food you get!",5
"It is what it is. No frills. Fine front desk staff and general cleanliness. I felt safe and the bed was comfortable. I'll tell ya - my favorite thing about this place is the bar Baer's Den at the end of the parking lot! 

The breakfast should not be $10, it should be included! I did however have a fantastic breakfast sandwich at the Safeway right down the street!",3
"The name sounds like it's straight out of a book filled with a happy storyline, friendly characters and sunny days. And Chestnut Lane, the eatery, lives up to expectations. For the ultimate lady who lunches, this should be # 1 in her book. 

I discovered this lunch spot awhile back and immediately made my way there to check it out. From day one, I was hooked and have visited several times. Chestnut Lane is small, quaint and every bit as charming as the house they call home. When I first walked in, I saw gorgeous fresh salads to the left, begging me to take them home. Fresh pastries, cookies and cupcakes lined the counter top and refreshing water made their home in reusable milk-type jars in the refrigerator. The owner runs the shop and takes great care of the environment and the food they serve. From ladies who lunch, to professionals on the go...this spot is normally packed during lunch hour, so get there early. 

My favorite dishes include: the lobster salad (worth every penny), the tuna meld, chopped salad and honey roasted chicken blt. It's hard to escape without a bag of their delicious cookies or a mini cupcake. If it's mini, that means zero calories right? :) For those looking for a healthier option, their fresh fruit is full of amazing berries, etc. 

Hours: Better hurry and make it during store hours! Chestnut Lane is only open Tuesday-Friday from 8-3 and Saturday from 8-1.",4
"I cannot stand this mall. They have some really awesome stores but the people who work in them are obnoxious. Most of the people walking around are snooty as can be, and everything is overpriced.

The food court has some good selection, but is always super crowded and you can rarely find anywhere to sit.

Parking is awful.",2
"This is by far my hubby's favorite lake for bass fishing.  I am not a fan of waking up at 4am in the morning to get there by 5am...not for fishing.  Yes, that is all my boys do here. It gets really packed on the weekends by 9am.   When the water is low, it is not easily accesible from the picnic spots.  It also gets super windy, enough to go windsurfing (too bad it's a long treck for us).   You really have to have a boat to enjoy this lake.  The absence of shade trees make the heat uncomfortable in the middle of summer, you might as well go to Canyon or Saguaro (my faves).

I love the sharp edged cliffs juxtaposed against the crystal clear water.  Good photo ops.

Why the 4 stars?  Like I said, my hubby loves fishing here for the bass.  For some reason, little bluegills like me.  I also like the floating porta-john and porta-jane...weird, but cool!  Whoever does the draining has a crappy job.

All in all, it is a nice big lake and by far one of the cleanest too.",4
"The customer service at this Macy's was seriously out of this world. Both my mom and I (who were visiting from out of town; me, San Diego and her, Baltimore) have never ever experienced such friendly and helpful customer service at any department store, anywhere, EVER! We were there late at night- probably for the 2 hours right before closing on a one day sale day. In every single dept. We went (ladies dresses, ladies shoes, men's etc) EVERYONE was soooo nice and helpful. Most of our visit was in ladies dresses. Those reps did everything possible to help us find dresses in different sizes (which can definitely be challenging at the end of a season and at the end of a one day sale when things are haphazardly placed everywhere) and to call other Macy's stores when we were unsuccessful in finding a dress at that location in a particular size. Sure, they wanted a sale, but to be so helpful so late at night, right before closing, after a long one day sale was shocking. We must have encountered at least 10 different sales associates while wondering through the store and each and every one was soooo nice and helpful. The selection (at least in women's) was better than most other Macy's I've been to, to boot. 

I wish this was my local Macy's! Go here- hopefully your experience is just as good as mine :)",5
"5 Stars for the delicious food & flavors. 

No stars for the tired, drab & dusty interior. Very disappointed. Needs a complete interior update overhaul and face lift. 

The food is great quality, but their portions are monumental, and rather unappetizing with the amount of food on the plate--although this could be appealing to others of a unsophisticated palette. 

Quite disappointed, but gracious that the quality of meat was outstanding.",2
"I have some issues with this place, but you can't avoid BRU when you are having a baby. It's got convenience, selection, and price going for it. 

We set up a baby registry here mainly out of convenience. It was fine, but I started noticing that they'd randomly discontinue items from the registry and about a week or two later put them back on. 

They aren't always the cheapest, but when you are strapped for time, trolling the Internet for deals isn't going to happen, and this is where BRU scores. They know they can get you when you are harried and need whatever.

The bathrooms are grody here. After being pregnant, I've seen a lot of bathrooms. It seems like a store catering to pregnant women, new moms, etc. would have nicer bathrooms because the likelihood is that we'll use them 9 times in a hour trip. 

Staff is generally friendly, and the store is well organized.  Selection in store is good.",3
"I am writing this update soley based on the feeling one gets when going to Spitfire Grill, the food and drinks are always good.

Our complaint about Spitfire is that the owner and staff is never very welcoming. My fiancee and I have been there 15+ times and there is never any recognition by the staff. The owner is always there and he has never introduced himself or thanked us for coming in again.  The servers have never said 'welcome back or good to see you again'. For a neighborhood restaurant I would think you would want to make your regular customers feel appreciated. We love the food and the restaurant is right around the corner from our house, but we lean toward other, farther away restaurants with a more weloming feel.
For example, last night we went to House of Tricks in Tempe. It was our 4th visit. When we walked in three of the employees greeted us and welcomed us back. The bartenders remembered what we drink and asked us about something we discussed last time we were there.
Talk about feeling welcome! Spitfire has a lot to learn if they want to survive in a neighborhood lacation.",3
"please please please do not stay here! 
i never do these reviews but i feel obligated to save someone the time and money and self respect by writing this review! the customer service is soooo soooo poor!! after having almost 500.00 held on my charge card after i checked out, i called to find out why this charge was on my account.  i was hung up on and after calling back was repeatedly hung up on and refused to provide his name to me or his managers name! i told him i work at a four star hotel and casino in las vegas (which i do). he called me a liar! .. and as of right now still out 500.00! what establishment hangs up on their guests? this guy should sit through some of the forbes training i have received! what if i was a shopper? 
do not stay here! save your money! they only received one star because you have to provide a rating.  
aside from the horrible customer service, they stuck me with a 50 penalty fee when i had to change locations. that wasnt great, but whatever, the pictures do not resemble the motel. the ""game room"" is not a game room.  its a room with an atari in it.  the pool was small and dirty and if you like noise all night while you are trying to sleep, you can count on it here.  all these things, i could get over. however, the customer service the man (i cant even say gentleman) on the phone was horrible and penalty should follow. he is an embarrassment to all of us who work in guest services. 
do not stay here! you would have a better stay in a box outside on a corner.
i should have known better for such an inexpensive place, but i was hoping if we cut back on the hotel we could spend extra money with the kids doing activities and going places... wrong! you get what you pay for... and worse!",1
"Food is yummy!!!! I have never been to a 5 Guys, so I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a burger, unaware that it is actually a double burger, which was HUGE! Hubby and I shared a large fry. We could have easily split a burger and a small fry. Love that fact that ""everything"" includes grilled mushrooms and onions. So much food. This location was messy. I am not sure of the peanuts are a great idea because there are shells and dust everywhere.",4
"I've eaten breakfast here a few times and always thought the food and service were good. I think the prices are reasonable. My only complaint is the place is too small. there have been many times the hubby and I go there and there is simply nowhere to sit, so we end up leaving. I wish they would expand the dining area as I would love to eat here more. I hate chain restaurants, but when this place is too crowded I end up at a crappy chain.",3
"Even though I am officially in my 30s, I look like I'm still in college, which made me feel slightly less uncomfortable when I walked into The Clubhouse. Yes, it is near ASU, and yes, it is an all-age venue, so I should have expected that the club would be filled with 18-20 somethings. But just because I look 21, doesn't mean that my internal reality made me feel a little out-of-place. But, I was like, whateva!

It is somewhat of a dive bar trying to be a club but failing miserably. Like a nerd trying to be punk or a cheerleader trying to be emo -- it somehow didn't work for me. It felt like I was in someone's basement turned rocker's haven. Black walls, haphazard decor, and one sole stinky quasi-couch that looked like it had been salvaged from some dump. 

The stage was at the front of the club, and the bar in the middle dissected the under-21 crowd from the over-21 boozers. Unfortunately, if you wanted to drink, you had to stay on the over-21 side of the bar. That sucked because you barely had a view of the stage. WTF?!  Shouldn't the paying lushes get a better view than the youngsters who only paid to get in the club? Stupid. I have to say, though, the sound system was a helluva lot better than some of the other small music venues I've been to.  That's a plus.  

Finally, this last annoyance will definitely show my age, but having to stand the entire time I was there was horrible. My feet hurt, dammit! And, I just wanted to sit down! But, I'll suck it up the next time because there are some great bands that play here, and for me, great music can make any situation better.",3
"10:30pm on a Saturday night.  My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night (see my review of Pearl for the first).  Place is hopping.  We take a seat at the sushi bar.

The Waitress:  ""Are you girls going to be ordering sushi?""
Me: I have a sushi menu in my hand, ""yes.""
Waitress:  ""Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too.""
Me: What the fuck, bitch. ""Uh, ok""

Dear Ra Waitress,

I'm sorry if I kept you or any other employess, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed.  It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine.  I was hardly the last customer in there.  There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me.  If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food?  Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot.  I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined.  Thanks for that.   

Sincerely,
Morgan",1
"I've heard when better waitresses are there, service is better, but if you go on the night she isn't there, service sucks.",2
"Good = Happy hour is a great deal but it's always PACKED. The open atmosphere is awesome in the spring/fall but there's not much seating so you'll likely end up waiting.

Bad = Parking.  There's never enough and it's a tight parking lot.  Prices.  It's expensive.  If I want to sit outside with friends and enjoy a bottle of wine and nibble on some fancy cheeses, I might as well do it at my house for 1/4 of the price.  Then I can drink as much as I want without the overcrowding and $$$$.",2
"Lives up to the local fuss. Quick, cheap, tasty and one of the few fast Mexican food restaurants that utilize yellow cheese, which is my cardinal rule of good Mexican food.",5
"Top notch cheesesteak. One of the best in the valley. This place has a large delivery area, and is located right by campus. The owners are really nice and friendly. I'm really glad something moved into this spot. It's so convenient. 

Their desserts are great as well. I wish they had some chicken options, but they are new and said they would be adding to the menu as time goes on. My girlfriend said the turkey sandwich was fantastic. They sometimes carry Tasty Kake, so ask about that. 

I've had the authentic cheesesteaks from Philly, and this tastes every bit as good if not better. It's definitely in my top 5 local cheesesteaks.

Edit: Just ordered delivery - Lightning fast! This place is incredibly legit. I went with a cheesesteak with White American cheese instead of ""wiz"" this time - So incredibly good. They tossed in a new dessert they didn't have last time which was awesome. 

Their prices are really good and their food is so delicious. I'm a huge fan. I'm not kidding with this 5 star rating - I love this place. Rave rave rave...",5
"So I'm not a big Chinese food fan, but my husband is. Truth be told, it usually makes me sick. But if I were to go to Chinese food, Dragon Palace would be one of the places that I would go. The food is decent and there's a lot of it. I really felt I was getting my value's worth.

The waitstaff was attentive (always there asking if I wanted a refill) and the food came out quickly. It looks like every other Chinese food restaurant in the world (lots of red and gold, lanterns, paper Chinese Horoscope place mat -- save for the deep teal walls).  I'm not sure I would make a long drive to Dragon Palace because chances are you have a comparable Chinese food restaurant nearby, but if you live in the 32nd St. and T-Bird vicinity, this is certainly a Chinese food place worth trying. 

As for the food, we ordered the Peking dinner for 2 which came with won ton soup, a pu pu platter (consisting of won tons - yum -, eggroll, a small fried shrimp, a skewer of glazed beef and honey chicken), Peking fried rice (fried rice with shrimp, chicken, pork and beef), Mongolian beef and the house chicken. (as an aside and a disclaimer, I am preggers right now and I have developed a severe dislike for chicken which means I, of course, hated the chicken dishes). My husband thought it all was ok. I really liked the won ton soup and the Peking fried rice. After dinner, we got the requisite fortune cookie (""Express yourself now."" WHAT?) and a really yummy banana wrapped in a won ton and fried with a sugar glaze thing.

All in all, it was a good time at a pretty good Chinese Food Restaurant.",3
"Well thought-through details make Lux amazeballs. 

The espresso is good. Really good. Like, I need to order an espresso along with whatever else I'm ordering just because it is so delicious. 

The food is beautifully presented (little light on the gluten free snacks, but there's fruit, so no one is starving). 

There's plugs all over.

The furniture is mostly easy to wipe down.

The bathroom door has written out instructions so no one is confused on when the door is locked. It also has nice smelling soap. 

The patio is really pretty.

The clientele seems ridiculously cool. I kind of feel like maybe I'm going to be cooler by association if I hang out here. I'M GIVING IT A GO. Let me know how I'm doing.",5
"Horrible! I had a gel manicure. The tech didn't let my old gel soak off long enough so she scraped, clipped and filed so hard to get it off that it left my natural nail extremely thin and flimsy. The new polish that was put on was thick in some areas and thinner in others. I didn't realize it until I got home. I grabbed my purse and almost broke my naturally long nails because they were so frail. I get the gel manicure because it has a thicker finish and makes my nails firmer. I called and told them about what happened. The gentleman who answered the phone told me that I was wrong and that they would not refund my money. I will never go back and I am sure sorry I ever did in the first place.",1
"Beautiful ,wonderful and very romantic ambient setting sets the tone for a romantic dinner with the one you love .

We first experienced El Chorro back in early April ,and were so enchanted with our patio dining experience ..beautiful view of Camelback MTN. lovely flora and landscaping ,and their adorable organic garden area. That we have returned a few times ,and every visit has been wonderful -impeccable service and delicious fare.

Dinner High-lights ;

Niman Ranch Steak ,twice baked potato ,asparagus.

Chopped salad and the Chicken Cobb salad both fresh and delicious.
Veggie pasta with shrimp .

Drink High- lights ;

Honey pot ( jack daniels lemonade drink)

The sticky buns are just sick !! we always take an order home .

Fabulous ! every time.",5
"I wasn't feeling RnR at all!  We don't usually venture into Scottsdale for many reasons, but the siren song of a non-pretentious late night eatery was just calling to us.  Unfortunately, non-pretentious doesn't apply to the prices.  We came shortly after opening day, so I completely forgive the awful service, the place was packed.  I was irritated though when we were told they were only going to be serving sandwiches and burgers, nothing else, even though we were specifically told that this place would have breakfast all day.  Breakfast is what I wanted.  Oh well.  

We ordered the burger and got some mini corn dogs as an appetizer.  The mini corn dogs left a lot to be desired.  They were served with plain ol' ketchup and plain ol' yellow mustard.  Yuck.  The corn dogs were only okay.  The breading around them was way too bread like and it was just lacking in flavor.  The burger was enormous.  Unfortunately, what it lacked any flavor.  I guess what it lacked in flavor it was clearly making up for in size.  The bacon that came on it was equally huge, roughly 2 inches wide and at least 8 inches long... (that's what she said! Ohhhh!)  Anyway, I was obviously not impressed.  We might come back sometime, because their breakfast really does sound wonderful, but hopefully they've figured out how to efficiently serve a busy restaurant by then.",2
"Let's talk about failure, baby.

Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!

I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.  

This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.

I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for.",1
"I really don't consider myself a Neiman's type of girl...
As a matter of fact, I don't really feel comfortable in Neiman's - it's extremely 'fancy' and high end for me.  But, I've gone in a handful of times and even bought a dress or two on sale at Neiman's in the past.  I admit, the quality associated with the designer labels at this store is pretty amazing.

Anyways, I felt some major pressure to register at Neiman's from my mom, so I met my mother-in-law-to-be at this Neiman's location on Sunday.  The housewares / registry department is extremely small... and although the woman working was sweet, she botched the spelling of Jared's name in the process.  Needless to say, i was not so impressed.

Fancy sums this department store up in my eyes - I'm much more of a Nordstrom's or Macy's or Bloomingdales type of girl!",4
"I was disappointed too.  I waited an hour and then took at seat at the counter which is ok with me, but if you've got long legs your only option is to sit spread-eagled in order to get close enough to your plate and there's not that much legroom to each side.  In the small space in front of the counter the staff was in perpetual motion squeezing past each other to get drinks, etc.   My cheddar, jalepeno, sausage omelette was very good, but not huge, and the hash browns were crisp and tasty on the outside but soggy on the inside.  The whole wheat toast was great, but no choice of toppings...I was given a small dollop of peach preserves. 
The waffles next to me looked fabulous, but I'm not a fan.   Basically I didn't think it wasn't worth the hour wait in 100 degrees and I was relieved to get outside where there was some breathing room.",3

"I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here. I had been to Johnny Rocket's before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here. I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want. 

We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA. 

About 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)

I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience. 

All I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat. Stress that to them. Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is.",1
"I think everyone has said most everything that needs to be said about this place. But I'll highlight the reasons I frequent Switch...

free wi-fi
good drinks
$5 recession plate special - that is always as awesome as the rest of their menu
good happy hour specials
open til 11pm 7 days a week
good wine 
great/friendly wait staff

their salads are out of control - amazing.

i think i could happily support/invest in switch/fez/ticoz dynasty for all of eternity...if i had the means.",5
"I went here for dinner last night with a group and we had excellent service. The specialty drinks were yummy and were a deal! My favorite (out of two I had tried) was the ketel-one pineapple martini! My sister had a house salad, the dressing tasted homemade, and the croutons were nice and crunchy! I had the Positano Steak Sandwich which was great, my only complaint it was a little too salty, and the fries (and I love fries) were tasty! Other people had the lasagna and they loved it. My sister had the baby back ribs and loved them. If you're looking for a pub-like restaurant that has good prices, pretty tasty food (with a good variety of items on the menu), and excellent cocktails, Keegan's is your place!",4
Waste of time. I could not even get in there today because there was a football game. The wanted me to pay $10 just to park. How stupid is that! 2 days before Christmas. I noticed all the prices were the same and somtimes more than any other mall. Goobye and good riddens. I have better things to do with my time and money.,1
"This place has really bad service and the food is barely decent, I would advise not to dine here. There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix.",1
"Very friendly, warm atmosphere.  We went for breakfast after hiking Camelback.  We figured we'd earned some fried chicken after making it to the top in 85 degree weather.  The food was really good.  Everything looked great! We got one of the breakfast specials - biscuits with gravy, 2 eggs and potatoes and I got 2 pieces of chicken with one waffle.  For once we didn't need any take home containers!  We ate every single bite which is very unusual for us.  I have to go back to get some more chicken and waffles but need to be sure I try the mac and cheese which I saw so many people enjoying and I need to try an order of their grits.",4
"Absolutely disgusting.  I had enchiladas and a taco, just to give them a chance.  This was the worst mexican food I've ever had.  Waaaaaay too much government tasting cheese on the food, and hardly any meat.  I do have really high standards because I grew up on Tex-Mex but this was just pathetic......",1
"Other than the really great happy hour prices, its hit or miss with this place. More often a miss. :(

The food is less than average, the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive) , but the service is truly hit or miss.

I'll pass.",1
"Strolled in with a posse of 14 people for a birthday party. The staff was accommodating in getting everyone seated and served with drinks, especially as people funneled on in throughout the night.  The place isn't huge, it can really only accommodate one large party at a time.

First off, if you are a vegetarian or Muslim, be aware that you are going to an authentic italian restaurant - meaning that 75% of their menu items will have sausage/ham/salami/etc. Being cognizant of that, it was a smart idea to peak at the menu before arriving. We got the Vegetariana Pizza ($14), which came with Mozzarella, Provolone, Caramelized Onions, Roasted Peppers, and Parmigiano Reggiano. I thought it tasted great, it was crispy, thin-crust and had plenty of cheesy to it. I thought it was an above average pizza, but nothing that would have impressed Emeril.

In addition to the pizza, we split the Spiedini al Forno ($16), which was Marinated Beef Tenderloin in a Shish Kabob style with Onions, Bell Peppers & Tomato. The waitress advised us in ordering the beef ""medium"" and no higher because it may get too dry or overcooked. I don't usually do medium, but she advised us correctly. It came out with only a little bit of redness and packed a good flavor. The onions, bell peppers and tomato are Kim Kardashian, meaning that they are all show and no substance. I didn't think they added anything to the entree and in fact, I didn't even eat them - which is rare for me to pass up on food. It wasn't like I was full, they just tasted bland.

For dessert, they brought the birthday boy a Dolce Della Casa ($12), which is a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and topped with bananas and vanilla ice cream. Everyone shared and It hit the spot. However, once the ice cream runs out, you're outta luck. The dessert is really complemented with the sweetness and coldness of the vanilla ice cream. 

The environment was kinda noisy (probably because we were a group of 14), and the wait staff was kinda slow (once again, because there were 14 of us), but they had a TV playing the knicks game so I was happy being able to watch LINSANITY, and the woodfire oven was blazing away for some good ambience. Overall, this place would be much better for a date or small group gatherings, otherwise you may be waiting for your food too long or feel a little crowded. Oh and just beware, the bill can become a little pricey if you aren't splitting entrees....",4
"being new to the area, i'm really on a quest to nail down my basic food groups: thai, persian, and mexican. mexican i've got down i think, but the other two i've kind of been baffled by. luckily i have my very own personal tour guide who invited me to lunch at yupha's one day. 

the place is pretty cute but can get pretty crowded when in the full swing of lunch. the tables are kind of close together, so be sure you arent carrying a big purse or anything otherwise you'll be whacking people in the head with it.

i had the pad thai for lunch. HUGE lunch portions. i could barely finish a third of it and i had a ton to take home for dinner. also if you arent into spicy, i'd definitely go mild. medium spicy is pretty groovin, but i dont think it would work out well for someone who only wants a little spice. yupha's also has an interesting salad bar/soup thing that comes with some of the lunches. check out the salad with the peanut dressing. mmmmmm peanut dressing. i loves it. 

service is fast and friendly. take your check up to the front if you want to get out of here quickly. i think yupha's is going to be my work lunch thai place :). garlic beef here i come!",4
"The sandwiches are truly AWESOME.  The Bobby is fab.  I went to the Chandler Rd location for years and now go to the Tempe location.

But, I give 3 stars because I've yet to have ""good"" service.  Something always seems to happen.  I call in my order, it gets lost.  I call in my order, I'm told they are too busy to take phone orders.  I go down and order in person, my order gets lost again.  I'm convinced I'm cursed.  I'll keep going back because that Bobby is the BOMB but service is what it is.",3
"This place is very popular and I can see why...the food was incredible!  Cool, neighborhood place with good service.",4
"I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.  
When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously.

Don't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.  

And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY I'M-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOU'RE NOT THAT COOL!",1
"On the verge of just giving one star I, I figured on 2 only because I enjoyed the cool open interior of the main restaurant. As far as the food. That is one star. 
While having just stopped in at the Ranch Market to pick up a few groceries, I was going to eat at the Market itself but decided to maybe try a place I had never tried near by instead. As I took my groceries to the car, I decided that since I had not yet tried ""Tradiciones"" I would give them a try. 
I enjoy the food at the Ranch Market-- tasty and authentic.  Since they are connected I THOUGHT the food would be the same. Boy was I wrong!  I don't know who they have cooking here, but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be A LOT better. 
The salsa should have been the first clue...it was just ok.  Again, knowing what they make in house next door, made this salsa pretty sad.  Wanting an Agua Fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 7+ varieties, I was disappointed they only had horchata and pina here. I got the pina, which was probably the best part of this meal. 
I was really craving some tacos, and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos. Also wanting to have a sopito, I thought WTH I will get the sampler platter and add a taco. 

The platter came with 2 mini chimis, 2 mini taquitos, 2 mini cheese enchiladas and a soptio each of chicken and beef. All looked good when it came out. I enjoyed the taco first...the last thing I was to enjoy on this culinary outing. Then, digging into the chicken enchiladas, the sauce was a ""mole"". This was not a good mole...way too sweet, someones idea of a mole. Yes, just because a mole has chocolate doesn't mean it's a chocolate sauce.  And the chicken, stringy bland kinda tough. Everything followed suit, bland not very authentic, someones idea of mexican food. It all reminded me of something I would get if in the Mid-west somewhere and wanted Mexican food...not Arizona! 

The only saving grace to this meal was that it was happy hour on a Saturday and the platter was 1/2 off and the taco was a buck so I left paying only $9 instead of $15. 

While I will continue to eat at the Market....I will pass on TRADICIONES...*blegh*.",2
"So Weekends are usually hubbys choice and he decided on Rock Bottom.

I don't mind coming here, I really like their Mac and Cheese.
You can get it with or without chicken.........years ago the chicken was this really thin shaved peppered chicken and I thought it was awful so I have since always ordered without chicken.

However today Hubby chose the mac and chicken and I was surprised that now they use real chunks of shredded chicken breast!! YAY! 
What and improvement!! It was really good! (see pics)
. 

I got  the Turkey Bacon Cobb sandwich minus bacon =Layers of juicy oven-roasted turkey breast on grilled sourdough bread with sweet peppered bacon, sliced avocado, roasted tomatoes, sprouts and mixed greens. Topped with rosemary dressing and Bleu cheese crumbles (see pics)

It was better  than I expected, they forgot to put avocado on it though and
the bread was really really good and for being grilled it wasnt over saturated with grease.

The onion rings could have been crispier but were OK.

Lame waitress today she was new but whatever...she sucked!!",3
"I liked this place... because it's a local owned place with delicious greasy food. This place was written up in the East Valley Trib in one of their ""5 to try"" pieces, which is where I first heard about it. But, I actually think it's funnier that I have been in ""Hall of Fame"", a store located direclty next door several times and never given Giant Hamburgers a second glance. 

You walk into this place, past a grouping of tables and booths (only about 15 tables in the entire place)  to the cash register where you order your meal. We each got a burger and fries and they were both great, a real gut-bomb, but sometimes you're in the mood for something that fits just that description. We sat and ate, and they came to bus our table for us. 

On the way out, we noticed the ""Yelp"" sticker on the door. Bonus points.",4
"i know, i know. this gelato is a bit on the pricier side, especially when you consider that phoenix now has a bajillion gelato shops, that  each offer a million and one flavors for a few washingtons. HOWEVER, arlecchino is definitely the BEST. it's worth theprice, worth the drive, and worth the parking hassle. 

the owners are super nice and accommodating, and although there is a sample limit, the workers have never said no more. the flavors are classic, inventive, fresh, and authentic. plus, it's such a cute, tiny little hole-in-the-wall shoppe, that you can't help but love it in all it's quaint glory.",5
"Bad quality ingredients. I ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful, hard, I tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up.",1
What can I say I love AJs especially the Boulangerie or coffee bar.  Jason is the best.   The pineapple ice tea with a slice of pineapple is deli-sh with a yummy cheese croissant.  I admit I usually get something from the coffee bar and bistro more so than the actual grocery store.  Oh and if you go check out the display/decorations they are usually pretty cool.,5
"Extremely friendly staff, very comfortable decor, and delicious food!  I enjoyed a sampling of a few different mezes and a greek salad - just wonderful!",4
"Got together with Mike C. to go out to a Thanksgiving Buffet today.  We tried for Golden Corral down the street in Gilbert but the line was way outside, so we came up here where there was also a wait, but shorter.  It was good, as always, but there were some negatives this time:

*  The soups:  There was an ordinary Corn Chowder, a weak Cream of Broccoli, & ordinary Chicken Noodle.  They should have done better than this for Thanksgiving.

*  There was no cottage cheese.  (They don't always have it, but at these prices they should have some today.)

*  There was turkey, but breast meat only & no dressing!

*  Over at the dessert bar there was no hot fudge (& it looked not as if it had run out, but rather that they just didn't offer any today).

*  There were no sundae cups.  I had to go over & get a soup bowl to make a sundae.

*  There was Hot Lava Cake (or ""Hot Fudge Cake"" I think they call it here), but it was sorely lacking in lava!

Thus, it's down to 2 Stars for this restaurant that wasn't as good as it should have been for the money.

Thanksgiving Buffet $12.99/$12.49 Sr.",2
"First time here--glad we came!  Free chips and salsa (always a great start to a Mexican meal!).  Hubby and I split the chicken fajitas, which were very tasty!  Good-sized portion with lots of red bell peppers, which we like. Served with side of rice and beans, guac, sour cream, and pico de gallo.  We each ate our fill and still had enough for a take-home 'fajita burrito' :D",4
"The service was very slow. People at several tables were waiting, far to long for, drinks checks food. The table had no bread plate , no salt and pepper. No napkins.  We had to ask for everything. The busser did not seem to understand how to set a table. We ordered the beet salad, it had no flavor and huge -hard as a rock  beets, no cheese. Tiny orange wedges.  No good. 
I ordered, for a main dish the Covina, white fish. It was so salty I had to send it back. The waitress then informed me that I ordered it wrong! Last time I checked you made sure your food tasted good and wasn't toxic with salt. She informed me that it was served blackened, blackened does not mean coated in disgusting salt. My hubby ordered capellini. The shrimp were undercooked and not fresh. There was very little tomato sauce. It was bland greasy and void of any redeeming qualities. Again , like the beet salad, the veggies were not prepared correctly ......
huge lumps of tomatoes, , mix yourself?  How do you serve pasta with no sauce ? Overall I would say the chef is not talented. No one bothers to prep properly, no one is tasting the plates as they are so bad it is impossible to believe the menu is being checked and corrected. In the meantime to go back for a glass of wine and an appetizer may happen as there is some potential , just a glimmer ....and , in a few months, if enough people review, and finally .....if the owner is smart enough to stop this unfortunate cascade . The patio is pleasant, I hope someone cares enough.",2
"I've been here twice...the first time was driven by a rumor that they made their own root beer.  I'm a sucker for homemade root beer, so I had high hopes that this place would become a favorite.  My husband and I were so excited when these huge glasses of RB hit the table!!  And then confusion...both of us looked at each other and said ""WTF???""  Worst RB EVER!

What the heck was in this drink that made it taste like ass?  We looked all over the menu and found nothing.  Then we saw the ""fine print"" on a small table sign...STEVIA.  It's made with Stevia NOT sugar...I'm sorry, but I have to say that this is the lame-est root beer on the planet.  If I'm going to treat myself to a big glass of homemade root beer, I want it to be delectable...sugar and all...no freaking high fructose corn syrup and no bloody artificial sugars (and yes, I know stevia is ""natural"" but who gives a crap...it tastes terrible anyway).

After the root beer debacle, it didn't get better.  The food was meh...service was not so great (there were moments of ""is she ever coming back???"").  I'd say, go here for the beer, sans root, but that's about it.  Otherwise, skip this place and drive out to Four Peaks...you'll be happier all around.",2
"With a few hours past and a few tasks accomplished the next stop of my day would be at Pane Bianco - the sandwich shop from the Valley's most celebrated Chef, Chris Bianco.  Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.

Arriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take ""any seat I wanted"" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.

Having debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive ""Grandma Slice"" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.

Moving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was ""wow - that is a lot of cheese"" while my second, after a bite, was ""wow - that is a lot of flavor.""  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.

Largely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.",5
"Walked in during late lunch hour. Did not get acknowledged for about 5 mins. When I finally got sat down, and served my salad, I found a hair in it. Got no apology. Just a sigh firm the waitress when she took it away. You can't pay me to go back here. The waiters are rude.",1
"Q: How many people and how many minutes does it take to make a ""toasty"" sub?
A: At Quiznos?  A LOT.

The food is decent, especially the tuna melt, and $5 for a large is a great deal.  But this place is SO incredibly slow, every time I go there I swear it's the last time.  Alas, living across the street from it I have caved and gone back a few times...  But seriously, don't come here if you've got groceries in the trunk, kids waiting in the car, or anywhere you need to be in the next hour.  

Also: I can't stand the oregano powder crap they dump on every sub.  Come on, Quiznos, there's gotta be a better-tasting distinctive touch.  I always tell them to leave this stuff off, and half the time they put it on anyway. 

FYI - once the sandwich is out of the toasting machine, toppings are available by request only.  No one's gonna ask what you want on it like at Subway.  You really have to speak up if you want onions, olives, or whatever else they've got hiding back there.

Please God grant me the willpower to stop coming back to this Quiznos!!!!!!",2
"Was here for a KYOT Wine-Down-Wednesday event a couple of years ago.  The bar area was packed.  Stood around waiting for a table to open up- very uncomfortable as the area is pretty small.  

I remember trying the New England clam chowder.  Tasty, but it had too much potatoes and not enough clams.  Had something else, but can't recall which, and the current menu online reflects a few changes.  

I do recall thinking I would like to come back and have lunch or dinner there, so I'm giving it three stars.",3
Still a fan. I'm incredibly impressed one of the staff even remembered my name and my last purchase on a return visit.,4
"The decor and ambience was very pleasant.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.   Granted, it was a Monday night and my wife and I were only one of three parties in the restaurant. 

  We ordered the hot and sour soup, the puu puu platter (sp?), chicken chow mein, and the curry chicken.  Everything was terrific.  The hot and sour soup surprised me - I'm not normally a very big soup fan but I thoroughly enjoyed it both at the restaurant and as left-overs the next day.     The portions of all of the orders were very big.  We had left-overs for three additional meals.",4
"One star would be giving it a holiday gift!

For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation. Unfortunately, Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement.

My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs. They were extremely over-cooked.  There was more charcoal on the top, back and ends that was just not editable.  Once you scraped away the charcoal, on the tops, ends and the center ribs, there was one that was eatable. 

The company offered me a second chance to try their food, by giving me a complementary full slap.  Nothing had improved.
They say they smoke the ribs, but there was no odor to that effect. In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed.
Btw...the waitress at the front counter couldn't even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were. When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily, she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night. The so called ""dry-rub"" seasoning was tasteless. The BBQ sauce is major strange!

The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging. ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket, but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor.

Overall if they don't change the way they 'burn"" the ribs, run, run or drive real fast to another place.  The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it!

Honey Bears, My Mothers or even driving to Famous Dave's is well worth the trip.
Sorry to burst your bubble, I too, had high hops for a centrally located rib place.  

I'm still waiting.",1
UPDATE: This location is closed. Boo!,1
"I have been coming to this place for atleast 5 years. This is a favorite of my friend's whole family. 

This place is so very consistent. They always have the same good things. If you're looking for buffet variety this is not the place. 

Everyone is so very nice. This place has been open for 30 years for good reason. I have never ordered from their menu because their buffet is so good. 

Go and try not to get hooked. 

Enjoy!",5
I've been for lunch half a dozen times and usually sit at the bar.  Their beers are great.  I'm a home brewer and am pretty discerning in my beer tastes.  Their HopKnot IPA has a huge nose of hops if you are a hop lover--which I am.  However the 8th Street Pale is probably my favorite.  It is a great balanced English style pale ale--without the bitter edge of an American pale ale like SN.  On a hot day their Kolsch is super refreshing and reminds me of being in Germany.  I've had mostly burgers and fries there and they are good.  The atmosphere is casual and the staff is friendly and attentive.  If you are a craft beer lover it is a nice laid back destination to enjoy a brew...or two.  They also pour growlers and sell cans of Kolsch and Kiltlifter in 12 packs.,4
"Ok, they should be happy that I am understanding of the flying bug that landed in my dessert and died before it was served.  Yes, I found it as I was eating the dessert, grossed me out, but not necessarily their fault.  The manager came over and apologized and took the dessert off the bill and offered me another one.  Anyway, the rest of the meal was great.  My party and I had the scallops with green beans and capers.  Yummy!  I do like Pappadeaux's overall and this is the first time I didn't have a great experience.",3
"I always have customer service problems with Fedex.  How the heck did they get to be so big with the crappy way they treat customers?  I use the Internet a lot for purchases and about 60% of the time, they screwed-up and then their customer service has major difficulty fixing the problems.  I have asked for shipments to be held at the closet shipping location to my office and they ship to my home.  Another time I asked for the same thing and they held it at the regional depot instead of where I asked that it be sent.  I can go on and on about the screw-ups I have experienced with Fedex.  

But this time they really pissed me off.  I get a harassing phone calls from a collection agency that says they have been contracted by Fedex to collect an overdue bill from me in the amount of $4000+.  I have asked them for details and all I get is harassment.  So I asked Fedex for help and customer service told me to contact Fedex Revenue Services, which I did.  I told them that I am getting harassing phone calls from XYZ collection agency and the person who keeps calling is named Chris.  I also tell them that the alleged amount owed is $4000+ and the account is supposedly in my name.  So I ask that they investigate and tell me if I indeed have an overdue account in my name for this amount.  (I know I do not have such an account!).  Fedex then tells me that they cannot help me because I have not provided enough information.  WTF?  How much more information can I provide?  Do they want my height and weight?  Maybe my blood type?  Maybe I have to provide the names and birth dates of my children too?

This is why I say that Fedex really blows!",1
"This 5 star rating is mostly for their boba! They are cool about how many flavors I put into my boba (usually about 4!) unlike other boba shops that only allow like 2

Their ramen is pretty good and decently priced. However, I don't like coming to this place much ONLY because I don't like coming out smelling like an Asian restaurant.",5
"Margaritas were good, tacos were fair (small), guacamole was wonderful. after ten it gets really loud here. They need to have tequila flights.",2
"I had the Soppressata with Aged Provolone & Roasted Peppers.  It was a solid sandwich overall.  The quality of ingredients was pretty good, but the only part that gets me is the price. $8 + tax?  Wow all that ""supply and demand"" stuff I learned in Econ class wasn't a joke.  Worth trying once, but I don't think this is a place I'll be grabbing lunch at on a regular basis.",3
"This in truth had been my first ""Cajun"" eats.

The atmosphere was cool.
The service was good.
The food was rich and filling.",4
"Good food, tiny portions, pricey for the amount you get.",2
"If you are in need of any kind of battery Batteries Plus is the place to go. They'll test your current battery for free, upon request, and I haven't found a battery that they didn't carry. They'll even replace the batteries for you in watches for free. I take all my watches to them rather than to a jeweler who is not only going to charge me for a battery, but will charge me for their labor as well. I even buy my regular batteries here because often times they are way less than at the grocery store.",4
"I have been to a buffet like this before, but I will never go to this particular one again. 

The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky. We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill. 

The cook doused our dishes with water, quickly cooked the ingredients, and returned them in a new bowl. 

There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite. 

Free-range and refills on beverages. 

Sat down to eat, was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting. The bowl of ingredients were all bland, perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling, and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad, The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well. We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving. Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me, and changes in selections. 

We could have taken the left overs home, but opted to leave them instead. 

Suffice to say, I do NOT recommend.",1
"Kimchi - 5 stars.
Other side dishes - OK. there is no date on it so I really don't know how fresh they are. I went there couple times to get side dishes other than Kimchi. it was not as good as Paldo. I only go to Seoul Market for Kimchi now.",3
"Sorry.  I'm from Southern California so I'm used to great Mexican food.  We were excited to try this restaurant, since we had read some great things about it.  However, the waiter was pompous and the food was mediocre.  We were in a party of four and we all ordered different meals.  The guacamole that was made from one avocado was $11.  The restaurant is in a scary location.  We had to park in a back alley.  It was agreed that the experience was a bust.  If you're in the area and want great food, go to Lon's at the Hermosa, Elements at Sanctuary or True Food Kitchen.",2
"This was my 1st spring Training baseball experience so I can't compare the ballpark with any other. 

However, as a newbie I can say that I appreciate the intimate setting. Every seat is a decent seat. Hubs and I had seat right behind home plate for less than $30. It's a really chill atmosphere. Feels like a college ball park.

The concessions are priced fairly. The bathrooms were clean. 

I had a great time. 

See you next year!",4
"Good choice of ingredients, a bit out of a student budget, but it was WORTHY all the way. I was drooling with the flavors! Good environment and good service and good music (bistro style). I'm not much of a pizza eater, but this has a good place in my list! Forget about your papa dough or cheap Sunday pizzas...this is a real one!",5
"I really like this place... they have great wine... try the tasting... it is 10 bucks and you get 5 tastes... they make almost all of the wine in house (i know the almond champagne is not made there)... i have not found any wine that i don't like... my favorite is their porto and chocolate port.

the other thing you can do is have a bottling party.  i recently purchased 30 bottles (at a great price!!!  cheaper then the wine stores).  they make the batch for you and then you have a party to bottle and label it.  this is a great and fun different party for you are your friends.  

despite it location it is a great place for a date...",5
This place is great!,5
"I was so excited to find this place, less than a minute down the street from home! Because I'm not a big panda express fan, but I love Chinese food. Sadly, I was disappointed. 

The orange chicken was very stringy and tasteless. The sweet and sour sauce was runny and mostly sour. The wontons were the only decent thing we ate there. 

If you want good, cheap chinese avoid this place and try Li's Bowl on 35th ave.",2
"Despite the nice layout, design, and store variety of the City Center, I was still heartily disappointed. Some friends and I were merely trying to find a parking spot to do some shopping and things of the sort when we were notified that it was going to cost us a hefty $30 to park in a MALL parking lot. Outrageous. Turns out the WWE was in town and I guess they wanted to get some extra cash out of the mullet sporting, dentally challenged fans of Wrestlemania. Cool I guess, but not for us that were just trying to buy some swag. They offered some sort of validation system to reclaim some of the $30 coughed up, but it all seemed more than shifty in nature so we decided to park elsewhere. 

Everything else about this nice outdoor shopping center is exceptional. So waddya say Westgate? Create a better system for those of us not there for the events at the stadium across the way?",3
"Walk the other way, just walk right the hell the other way...

Here was how this played out.  Oktoberfest a few days ago.  Starting the night off.  I walk past this place and see a place that sells a slice of pizza for $1.99.  Good, right?  No.  

me: ""Hi, one slice of pizza please""
guy: ""you buy drink with it, 4 dollars.""
me: ""no, just one slice of pizza""
guy: ""we do not sell one slice, you have to buy a drink.  4 dollars""

I should have pulled a flag on this play at this point, but knowing I was going to be drinking I move forward wanting food in me. Not a wise move.

me: ""so, I can't buy one slice?""
guy: ""no, you buy a drink with slice, 4 dollars.""
me: ""It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu or walls""
guy: ""No, do not sell one slice.
me: ""what the... O.K., give me 2 slices of pizza""
guy: ""you buy two slices then.""
me: ""yes, Jesus Christ, yes""
guy: ""toppings?""
me: ""no, no toppings.  cheese.""
guy: ""we have toppings.""

what is this guy, fucking deaf? 

me: ""no thanks""

I give him the money.

guy: ""it take 10 minutes, you wait.""

I don't think they run the air conditioner in this place, so I wait outside.

Pizza comes out.  Tastes like absolute crap.  I eat it outside because in September in Chandler Arizona it is cooler outside then inside this place.  I think they had the thermostat set to ""HELL"" Guy working or running the place comes outside and stares me down as I am eating.  I'm sure if you want to eat here you can check the dumpster for plenty of slices to try beforehand to avoid having to pay for one.  Excuse me, avoid having to pay for two.  However after what I had served to me I'm pretty sure they will beat you to the garbage cans and sell it back to some other unsuspecting soul.  I was the only one dumb enough to finish all the food.  Wouldn't eat here if there was a natural disaster and this place was the last to be ransacked for provisions.  I'd keep walking.

FAIL.",1
"After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years, I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands. It was an issue of ""protecting the thumbs."" When I told her I didn't like forearms and elbows, she explained that she'd never worked without using her forearms (and, I assume, her elbows, too). After just five minutes, when I asked for more pressure, she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn't the ""therapist for [me]."" She was right. What are they teaching these people these days, and why doesn't an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff? I won't offer her name, but, if considering a massage at this establishment, I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money.",1
"Found this place by accident.  Not the greatest location.

The pulled pork rates about an 8 on my scale.  Didn't need sauce, but the sauce (sweet) was good.  The Ranch beans are a tad spicy but still good.  The slaw needs a little help.

I will definitely go back and sample the rest of the menu.",3
"This place has a lot of potential; I really want it to do well. I went there on Saturday night with my husband around 7 pm and it was jam packed. Good for them! We felt a little out of place since it was a much much older crowd, (in bad capris, shorts and flip flops...doesn't anybody make an effort anymore? This part of town, I guess.) Anyway, we had a nice booth, but it was directly across from the pizza oven, so we were quite warm. Pleasant server, good busser/foodrunner keeping our waters filled. We decide to try the Bruschetta for a starter and the Rib-eye dinner for two for $28...an unbelievable price. The Bruschetta was quite good (and at $6 also a good value) and with a nice mozzerella and balsamic drizzle...it was tasty. The Rib-eye's on the other had, were not so nice. But, I must stress, these meals were $14 each...what did I expect? The steaks were large and tough; my husband said his tasted old. Yikes. Mine wasn't that bad, and the potatoes and veggies were flavorful. Our thoughts, under the premise of ""if we were running this restaurant"", are: we would have offered a much smaller but higher quality piece of steak. Food for thought, Javino's. In our opinion, quality over quantity every time.  As we were eating we were able to keep an eye on the drama with the staff...and  watch how hard those boys in the kitchen were working! It was really busy, and they all did seem to work well as a team, manager included. At one point, a sweet, young server comes back with a couple of plates to the manager  (I guess someone sent back there food) and burst into tears. Ah, we felt so bad! I hate it when customers make the server cry and if the food was no good how on earth is that her fault?! Well, major points to the manager who gave her a big hug and went to deal with the table. I was impressed. Also, live music going on... a very nice touch. We left feeling like it was an okay place, I liked better than my husband, but something was just kind of ""off"". Maybe they have an identity crisis? Are they a wine bar or are they trying to be fine dining? Either way, I definitely want to go back again soon to try something else on the menu. If for no other reason than how kind that manager was to the server. I have worked in the industry and have been treated like garbage in the same situation. So, kudos. Your staff looks happy.",3
"They don't have the lunch specials on the menu or tell you about them if you don't ask, so make sure to ask. The sandwiches don't come with fries and their fries are over priced for not being very good. The pulled pork sandwich is good and so is the sauce. Also, expect a long wait especially if people are ahead of you.",3
"Postinos on the East side!?

Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to Postinos, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say I can't get enough 
You know I'm gonna have to face it, I'm addicted to Postinos 

Thanks Robert Palmer and let's just say I wouldn't be surprised to see the fashion models around here.  Very attractive crowd!  I am honor just to be here!  

Another bottle of wine and you'll be mine, a one track mind 
I can't be saved 
4 flavors of Bruschetta is all I crave 
If there's some left for you 
and don't mind if I do 

I might as well face it I'm addicted to Postinos

I've always enjoyed attending Postinos on the West side of town, but the East side adds a new flavor.  The place still has a great deal on Monday and Tuesday nights.  Bottle of wine plus a large plate of bruschetta's for $20!  The ambience is always chill and low lighting.  Quite romantic and add some pretty ladies and I'm golden here!  Service is always great at Postinos.  The staff is definitely well train in the knowledge of wine and their service is spectacular! - Enjoy!",5
Pet smart did a better job at grooming my dog than my last mobile groomers. They cut and wash my dogs hair just how i like them. Service was nice the young ladies were always helpful since two dogs on a leash can be difficult. I shall return to get my dogs groomed here.  Would recommend.,5
"I don't really get what all the buzz is about. Coming from SoCal I think In N Out has this place beat. I can get a small burger and small fries from Five Guys and I am beyond full the rest of the day. The Cajun fries are OK but I kind of freak out when the bag carrying your food gets stained from all of the grease.
Why I'm giving three stars instead of two is that I JUST discovered their hot dogs and those are FANTASTIC. I never need to have another burger from here, I'll stick with my double doubles......but the hot dogs???? VOILA!!!!
And their soda machine is really cool too. It's touch screen so once you pick your soda, you then get to add flavors. It's really cool. If they had a soda machine on The Starship Enterprise, it would be the soda fountain from Five Guys....except that it would have to be voice command.
Anyway, I'll be back for the weiners and to play with the soda machine",3
"Having a miserable experience flying from Boston to Reno. My connection was in Phoenix, and the flight from Boston was running a bit late. I asked both of the flight attendants if it would be possible to deplane before the other passengers as I had a very tight connection to make. One actually laughed at me and told me I would be fine. 12 hours, a horrible nights sleep (as they did not offer me hotel accommodations) and two delicious airport meals later I am sitting in the terminal waiting for my flight from Phoenix to Reno to board. Sorry buddy, not really fine. I missed my flight by 5 minutes. I would have been fine if US Airways offered their customers with tight connections the opportunity to deplane first, as every other airline I have flown on does. Will avoid them at ALL costs!",1

"I only ask for two things when I'm flying. To land safely. And to not fear planes while on them.

US Airways only delivered on one of those, and I'm still undecided on the first one.
Took a flight late from PHX to SFO. Two hours isn't too bad. Unless of course it was the longest two hours of your life and you could hear people in the cabin praying for their lives.
I understand that turbulence is normal. But I would rather you cancel another flight because it is too dangerous to fly, then to put passengers through the scariest flight of their lives.
Oh and when you finally do land and are thanking your maker that you are in fact still alive, its probably best that you don't have to overhear the pilots saying ""Wow, that was scary. I'm surprised we landed alright.""
Morons. They should pay for the trauma I'll have for the rest of my life.",1
"This place is more miss than hit, I stop by here for breakfast on rare occasions and the food usually comes out more than slightly mangled.  

The food is usually edible and the customer service at the window is always friendly.  I've never had the experiences that Phoenician C has but I will admit that this can be one of the lower end McD's that I've been to in this town.

"Recently bought a house and had issues with the speed and interference with the very many wifi networks around me.
I decided to go wired so after I did a lot of research on how to get a wire from my second floor to first floor for the entertainment center. I bought a lot of tools from Fry's electronics and then after I started actually looking at what I had to do, I realized it would not be something I can do myself.

I called good guys electric and they came over and ran a couple of wires using CAT6 instead of the CAT5 I would have used through the (nail-ridden) attic and through walls without any wires sticking out while they kept away from the electrical wires to prevent interference.

I returned the tools and wire I got from Fry's electronics and that made the install very affordable.

I'm very happy with the quality of my network speed now, being able to stream HD content from my server upstairs to the TV 200 feet away.

After completing the network-wiring job, I had them install a new chandelier on a remote-controlled dimmer switch which was done quickly and works great",5

There is lots of cute baby stuff that I would laugh at if I ever saw a baby wearing.  The jewelery is unique and cool- it made me feel like I had etsy right in front of me, live!  They have some good books around and some key David and Goliath pieces.  

I heart places like Made, so therefore I heart Made.",5
"This place used to be quite good but I think they may have had an ownership change recently.  Over the past 12 months or so we have seen the quality of the food and service level both drop to unacceptable levels.

The food is overall average - the fajitas down right poor and the drinks very inconsistent.  They do get somewhat busy with a bar crowd but that too seems inconsistent so when they do get busy the service gets very bad.

When service deteriorates the Manager (or owner, I'm not sure) seems to hide from customers. 

Overall, make the trip down to Shea Blvd and find much better at better prices.",2
"I'm generally very fond of Rubio's, but this location just isn't up to snuff. The food is good, but somehow not quite as good as other locations (it doesn't seem as fresh). The restaurant isn't as clean as it should be, the tables are always kind of sticky, and the restroom... well, it smells like swamp gas (and not just once). Also some of the seats are town and have been ""repaired"" with large amounts of tape (the tape is worn and sticky and if you're a dude wearing shorts, it will pull the hair right off your leg!) ...To be fair, I guess it could pull the hair off a non-dude's leg too, but let's just not go there.",2

The muffins are the size of your head.  Lots of calorie-laden treats.  I had some carrot cake once and it had that stale refrigerator flavor in the icing.  What a waste. 



My advice, walk across the street to Starbucks. At least you'll get a mediocre cup of coffee instead of a bad one.",2
"This place rocks!!  We bought 750 sq ft of tile a few months ago to install on our own and we had no idea what we were doing.  They helped us every step of the way. We made several visits over the course of about 3 months and everyone we talked to was helpful and knowledgable. I will absolutely go back when we re-do the floors in the rest of the house.

And the prices are the best.  I am a bargain shopper and will research prices for months before making a large purchase and that is exactly what I did when we embarked on this project.  I researched prices all over... online, in stores, with contractors, etc and Floor and Decor by far had the best prices.  The entire floor cost less than $1500 in tile, materials, and tools. It looks beautiful and I couldn't be happier!",5
"I just moved to the area so use Yelp but was very sad that the experience here was not worth making a return visit.  The only reason I am posting is because it has not been reviewed in so long.  

I did not like how the spa pedicure was one price and then things you would expect in a spa pedicure was ""upgrades"".  I want to ask for a pedicure and then lay back enjoy the chair and some reading.  

After the pedicure, the woman left me in the chair for my nails to dry and think she completely forgot about me!  I would have left if she had put my flip flops on before painting my nails. 

Their child was cute, but I do not go to get a pedicure to play games with other peoples children.  

Then to top it off, when I paid she asked for my pin as she was walking away (again)....no pin, it was a credit card....usually this would not bother me but I was already frustrated at this point.",2

"After hearing good things about the Scottsdale location, I was looking forward to lunch at Arcadia Farms when visiting the museum for the Ansel Adams showing.  Unfortunately, it was a little disappointing.

Service was painfully slow.  I'm not sure if that was the kitchen or the server, but in either case, I was not impressed.

We started with the baked goat cheese.  For some reason, I envisioned the caramelized onions and roasted tomatoes atop the cheese, but everything was combined.  While it was quite good, only the bottom portion was hot.  The rest of it was only lukewarm.  I wondered if perhaps the dish is prepared ahead and refrigerated, resulting in the uneven temperature.

We also shared the smoked turkey and warm brie sandwich with white bean salad.  They generously served each of us a full side of the salad with our half sandwich, which was more than enough.  Although the sandwich had just been grilled, the inside was still somewhat cold.  I also would have preferred just a little more apple, but overall, it was A-OK.

The white bean salad with red peppers and possibly cucumber if I remember correctly was sorely lacking in flavor.  Salt helped, but not enough to save the dish.  If it was dressed with anything other than oil, I missed it.  

Arcadia is just fine if you're already at the museum and looking for a bite.  Otherwise, I don't know that I would return.",3
"When I was in highschool various clubs used to sell Karsh's bagels around campus to raise money. I would buy a bagel and cream cheese and hide it in my backpack to munch on during class. Soooo good!

The guy behind the counter was nice enough, I told him my order which came to $2.95 or something just barely under $3.  I had failed to notice the sign which said they do not accept credit cards for purchases under $3. I apologized and said I didn't have any cash and offered to run the the ATM.  The guy behind the counter very nicely asked other lady behind the counter  (the owner? manager on duty maybe?) if she would let me use my card. She looked right at me all stink-eyed and said ""No"" and returned to what she was doing. No apology, no ""I'm sorry but there is an ATM at so and so...."" Very curt. 
Thanks a lot personality plus! I will not be returning and I hope you choke on a matzo ball. 
Shame too, I loved those bagels.",1
"I finally saved up the amount I am willing to spend to make my backyard not look like tent city. mind you, i have never been to tent city but i have a feeling they look similar. minus the pool. 

my backard is set up where the pool takes up the entire yard and then a maximum of 5 feet surrounding rock space around the entire pool. welcome to my backyard.

this makes planting difficult. my original dream was to plant oleanders along every wall, let them grow super tall to block all of my neighbors and give me the privacy i've always wanted to skinny dip all summer long. don't judge.

I wanted oleanders because they sounded like a match made in heaven for my lack of green thumb. they're cheap, they flower, they grow fast and they're impossible to kill. well, i found out oleanders roots are too aggressive to be that close to my pool so sadly, no go. (i only have 5 ft, they need 10-15ft) 

I called moon valley to get some ideas so I could do research root systems. the guy on the phone just wanted to get me there. i told him i was looking for suggestions before heading there on this rainy day and he just kept saying in the cheesiest voice known to man 'oh ya, come on down, we have hundreds'.

you have hundreds of plants that are identical to oleanders minus the roots and resemble in price? really??? please list them so i can find out if you're a big fat liar. nope, not listing them. only wanted to get me there. i decided not to go because 1. it's raining, 2. he lied and said oleanders are ok. i just have to have the drip system on 24/7. thanks for your freakin help.  3. he's a liar so even if i went they would lie to me. 4. i hate liars 5. i went in before in the past and told them what i wanted, they gave me a free backyard design and they completely didn't listen to me and created a backyard that cost 2k. who do they think i am? i live in mesa for crying out loud. not paradise valley. i wasn't going to let them waste my time like that again. 

if you're wondering why i could give them a 2nd chance after that- it's bc this time *I* was going to wear the pants in the relationship.

you could have had my entire (low) budget moon valley, but the unwillingness to help or be honest means i will be going elsewhere. someplace that will straight up say 'i can fulfill your skinny dipping in privacy dreams, while making your backyard look pretty as cheaply as possible and i won't destroy your pool while i'm at it'",2
Best customer service you can find! I buy all of my reptiles and feeders from these guys!James the owner is awesome and very eager to answer any and all questions you have.he will even probe your snakes for free!Every animal i have bought from them has been in tip top shape!Their prices are great and the employees are awesome!I suggest them over any and all shops in the east valley including az reptile center and predators.Give em a shot you will be glad you did!,5
"Staying at the Royal Palms has been on my bucket list for a while now, because I've stayed at just about every other resort in town that I've really wanted to check out.  Oddly enough, this also happens to be the closest one to where I actually live, so it seems strange to drop a load of cash to stay in a hotel four miles away from home.  

No matter, last month was my golden birthday and this is where my lovely girlfriend decided we were going to stay.  Score.  We had my party (a surprise, nicely pulled off) and we invited a bunch of people back to our room afterwards to continue the festivities.  It was a pretty standard room, a bed, fireplace, a couple of chairs, big bathroom, a table and chairs on the patio (I believe they call it a valencia suite).  Life was grand.

Until the morning.  *bang bang*  WTF is that noise?  *bang bang*  There was pounding and various noises coming from the room next to us, and it wasn't happening on the bed.  Are they really doing construction at 8:15am?  It continued.  My girlfriend called down to the front desk.  The noise stopped.  Then it continued.  *bang bang*  We were about to lose it. They called our room, ""do you mind if they continue working?"".  Actually, we had just fallen back asleep...

So this is not how the Royal Palms treats their guests.  No, any resort with a Director of Romance is serious about making their guests stay enjoyable, so I knew this was not normal.  A conversation took place, and profanity and yelling wasn't even necessary.  Essentially, they were going to comp our room, but they offered that we stay another night in the presidential villa for the same price...how could we say no?

I hung out at the resort all day because I was feeling miserable.  They comped lunch, and about 4pm, they moved us to our new room.  Nice place, the presidential villa.  It's actually only one bedroom, but has a huge living room, dining room, kitchen, two fireplaces, three patios with fireplaces and water feature, old-school tub, double-shower with outdoor shower, a bidet,  you know...typical amenities.  I was still feeling terrible (yay, the flu!) , so we opted to order room service from T. Cooks.  Naturally, if they hadn't done enough, they comped dinner as well.

We had an extremely atypical experience at the Royal Palms our first night, I have no question about that.  But they more than made up for it.  They were gracious, they smiled, they apologized, and they made it right immediately.  I can't ask for anything more from that from a place that prides itself in its customer service.  

I would not hesitate to stay here again.",5

i stayed at the firesky and had dinner at taggio for two nights in a row - not by design but necessity and i'm here to report that even though i didn't choose this restaurant for both meals, i'd come back again in a heartbeat.",4
"Good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle. First of all you have to leave your purse at the counter. I am not comfortable doing that anywhere. Who does that? The only place I have ever seen this before was ASU's bookstore. 

Then you walk in this warehouse that has NO air conditioning!!! I made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day (111 degrees out, yikes!) Then you get inside and you have to carry a catalog to refer to for prices since items are unmarked in large boxes. 

If they had a/c it would have been worth it to save a few bucks on the toys my dog destroys in minutes but no air conditioning??? IN ARIZONA?? Madness!",1
"Kristi's review said, ""Great romantic spot to bring a date. Secures that you will be getting action later, trust me."" Well, that's good enough for me. And before the Yelp paparazzi shows up to muckrack... no I didn't take Kristi to Cheuvront's. I know better than that - I only hang with Kristi at dive bars. 

So I did take my lovely date to Cheuvronts. The decor and ambiance - think wide open and urban and dark without being too dark. It really set a mood. We ordered a bottle of wine from a fantastic list, along with a cheese plate and a pate plate. We had them select the cheeses to pair with the wine we had chosen with a few instructions as to cheese preferences. They have a selection of pates as well, and we had them choose similarly.

The cheese plate contained three cheeses, all superb. It was served with (good!) bread, some nuts, and some dried cranberries. The two pate plate was similarly served with bread and dark, delicious mustard. The pates were fantastic - the cheese plate and pate plate seemed destined to be served together. 

The food and drink were great, the service a little spotty especially since there weren't that many people in there. I'm guessing the waitress just didn't want use to feel like she was bothering us. After taking our time to enjoy the wine, cheese, and pate, we were both feeling full with no room for even dessert. 

Overall, a great meal, my date thought it was one of the best places she had ever been to, and I'm clearly going to have to pay more attention to Kristi's reviews.",4
"Where to begin?

This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.

Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like, seriously, I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake. 

It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always.

If you haven't gone... you're missing out.",5
"I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest.  I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .  I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree.

When my salmon dish came out I said to my self ""WHAT in the hell?"" Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.  Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap?  I work in the food industry and the food was crap.

Next, the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again ""What in the HELL?""  Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.  The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap.

The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.  I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasn't even mediocre.",1
"No cover and outdoor misters. Decent crowd, overpriced drinks, teeny dance floor, good selection of d'bags to giggle at. It's A.) a club, B.) in a chain hotel, C.) in Scottsdale, fer chrissakes. What more could you ask for? My only hangup was how dark they keep it in there. People in Scottsdale are generally good looking, so a little more lighting in there isn't going to hurt business one bit. 
Overall... this place doesn't feature anything that really stands out.",2
Had just gotten off a long flight and wondered into Aunt Chiladas for the first time.  Loved the food and the margaritas !!  Will go back again.,4
"Before a Suns game recently, my Family and I stopped into Blue Hound for some drinks and appetizers.  We attempted to go to Arrogant Butcher (been there many times), but it was packed.  Having heard good things from another family member, we decided to give Blue Hound a try, and I'm glad we did.  The inside decor is trendy and simple.  We sat at the couch by the door (since that was what was available) and were quite comfortable - except for the occasional draft from the door.  Our waitress was ok, she wasn't entirely too friendly, but she took care of our needs.

As for the food, we ordered pretty much all the appetizers.  The biggest highlight was the scones with bacon jam.  In fact, it was so good, it's inspired me to make these two things at home to see if I can replicate it.  We also had the popcorn, which was good and the sliders, which were alright.  The pizza with duck was great (could have been crisper) as was the other items we had.

Based on the previous reviews it seems this place, being new, might be hit or miss.  I'd say give it a try if you're in the area... why not?  Trust me, it's worth a visit for the cheddar scallion scones with bacon jam!",4
"The food was amazing and beautifully presented. The atmosphere was clean, quiet, serene.",4
"fry's is conveniently located at w germann rd and s alma rd, has a reasonably large selection, and prices are fair.  when grocery shopping, i look for and purchase items based on the best value in terms of product, freshness, selection, and convenience.  i check the weekly sale ads and circle the best buys usually at 3 different food & drug stores.  since these are consumable, recurring items, i will look for opportunities to stock up when great deals come up. the site is clean, well stocked and well organized. common purchases include some baking goods, packed meats, breads, cereals, canned products and eggs. a surprising find...there's a sushi kiosk at the back of the store near the packaged meats section.  so, i buy the freshly made sushi - spicy crab roll, cali roll and tuna roll. it's actually really good.  i usually shop for produce elsewhere, same with laundry products, beauty products and dog food.  those reviews to follow soon.  scored a little lower since parking is usually a near-accident on the weekends, with so many vendors and customers-in-such-a-hurry at that busy shopping center.",3
"I had a good time at Monkey Pants, we celebrated a buddy leaving for basic training. I will have to go back again. And the one o'clock shirtless shot was awesome. Sorry I don't have more to report because I was drunk and don't remember much else, so that tells you it must be good.",3
"Sushi is absolutely nothing to write home about. They have happy hour all day everyday, which is a great way to start your night. The Korean pork tacos are bomb! Great location in Old Town Snottsdale. Love the staff and atmosphere!",3
"Chain restaurant that's just about okay for afternoon dining with friends. If I wasn't having beer at lunch I'd probably suggest eating someplace else. Food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal. I've eaten here about half a dozen times during the past few years when in town for business weekends.

It is centrally located on the corner of Mill and Fifth Street in downtown Tempe, amongst quite a few other local restaurants. During my most recent visit I ordered a steak at lunch along with one of the seasonal brewed beers. Steak was okay but I wouldn't order it again. Beer was exceptional, so I wasn't unhappy overall.

I love burgers and I think I'll stick to that as my primary choice when eating here in the future. I can't think of any times when service was particularly unsatisfactory, nor were there times when service really stood out as exceptional. I have almost always eaten here on a Saturday afternoon, and it's typically been fairly busy during the lunch hour. Never had a problem getting a table, which is important since I'm usually heading back for an afternoon conference session.

I love the big glass beer mugs (not sure what size they are) but I can't always down the whole thing during a short lunch break (I'm a lightweight).

Overall, good place to eat if you're hungry and in the downtown area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here.",3
"Was a bit dissapointed after reading reviews here! I had the fijitas, wife had tacos. Didnt think the inferno  (green hatch chili)was all that hot!!!
The Taco meat was not spiced bland. Best part of the meal was the bean dip and chips even the salsa was nothing great!!! At least the beer was cold   ut at 13.00 a pitcher it better be!!!",2
"I haven't been here in a while.  I like how they have remodeled this Fry's, even though it is not even 5 years old, they revamped it a little.  Today they had awesome deals for certain participating items.  I am glad I read the flyer I got in the mail.  I am glad I have their VIP card, I got a lot of stuff for only $45.",4
OMG this place is good. Great Italian beef. Great burgers. FRY SAUCE. I don't know how they're pulling off such good food with what they have but it's awesome and I will be eating here if I'm in the area and hungry.,5
Honestly I don't get it.  I went to Dos Gringos with a good friend of mine last weekend.  I had never been to Phoenix before so I was excited to see what the city had to offer.  After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 21 minutes before a waitress came to our table.  She brought us 2 beers and never came back. After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren't welcomed at Dos Gringos.  So we went up to the bar where I waited for 5 minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends.  What I didn't understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working.  If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment.  I will never return and I highly recommend you stay away from Dos Gringos as you will be disappointed.,1
"Quite possibly the best place to eat in Mesa. Let me tell you what you are in for if you go. 

The CPC has taken these pilgrim pockets to the next level.  Personally I would recommend The Royale With Cheese or the Shepard's Pie. The pies take a while to make so now would be a good time to order drinks as well. If you are the beer drinking type I would suggest the Hoegaarden it's the best I've ever had. If you are looking for something more stimulating you may want to try their Irish Car Bombs. Or if you are you are up to it go with both.

When your pasty arrives don't touch the plate! It could be scorching bloody hot. Your pasty is probably going to take a few minutes to become edible as well, just stay clam it will cool soon enough. 

When you have finished eating get the apple stuffed pasty for desert. By now you will feel very full, I know, I do it every time and the only thing I can say is that it was worth it.

Cheers!",5
"This pizza always tasted great but lately I feel like they have cheapened their ingredients. I realize its $5 pizza but it just tastes different to me now. If it weren't for the flavored crust I would not come back. 
But the main reason I have not returned to Hungry Howie's is because the last time I wanted to place a pick up order I was turned down. I asked for a reason and was told that they received a very large company order and they were not taking regular orders at that moment. 
You'd think they would be able to accommodate everyone even if a large order was placed.",2
"I came here with me sister Cher, who really likes this place. I'm so used to food being prepared by cooks and brought to me. So, I'm not used to having to prepare my own food via restaurant. I love to cook from recipes, so why should this be any different, right? 

As we arrived there wasn't that many people, I was relieved and allowed me to ask my sister 101 questions about what to do. I ended up making a concoction of beef, carrots, broccoli, rice noodles, sprouts with chef's favorite sauce. It turned out good but I know that I was missing something. I tried some of my sisters bowl and that was really good.

So, this place is a build-your-own bowl, piled high if necessary, and watch it cook right in front of you.

It was a little overwhelming at first, but if I continue to go there, I will get accustomed to the process.",3
"Nice selection of stuff, but they have so little help available you will wait for darn near forever to get fabric cut, THEN wait in line forever to pay.  For such a giant store, it appears there are 3 employees.  That's it.  I miss Hancock Fabrics, THEY knew how to treat customers.",1
"Love this Cold Stone if only for the fact that around the time you would be leaving dinner in one of the close restaurants, the strip mall this location is in is basically shut down. We didn't have any wait whatsoever.",3
"I have used Sandella's on three different occasions for catering lunches to business offices. 
Jeff ( owner) does a fantastic job at not only running a great business but also with the quality of food he prepares for customers and excellent customer service and catering as well. 
My offices that I bring lunch to love this food fare. It is a healthy alternative that many of my offices are craving after having so many lunches brought to them that weigh them down and make them feel like going to sleep after lunch. As a part of our healthcare community this food is something I feel confident about bringing to my colleges and offices that I visit. It taste great, it is made with only the best ingredient personally selected by Jeff and it is best of all , healthy.",5
"Every friday, my dad and I eat here. We order the same thing... pizza wraps. they are good and fillng. iced tea hits the spot. Typical strip mall pizza.",3
